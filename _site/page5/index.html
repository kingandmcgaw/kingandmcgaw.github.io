      <p class="updated">Posted on 23 March 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p>There has been some debate internally about how naming our systems and applications. On the surface it may seem trivial, I find having a naming scheme really helps for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussing how systems relate to one another. It&rsquo;s much easier to talk about Bootstrap than &ldquo;The Twitter CSS Framework&rdquo;. Significant advances in the application may result in new names, meaning less talk of &ldquo;the new system&rdquo; and &ldquo;the old system&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Organising Git repositories. Calling things &ldquo;API&rdquo; or &ldquo;CSS framework&rdquo; is boring and not specific enough to be useful.</li>
<li>Every project deserves a little personality of its own.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/naming-schemes.jpeg" alt="Naming schemes"></p>

<p>So, with that in mind, we have decided to use movie directors as the naming scheme for our systems, starting with our new API-driven platform, Kubrick. So if &ldquo;<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html">there are only two hard things in Computer Science</a>: cache invalidation and naming things&rdquo;, perhaps we have reason to celebrate!</p>

    <p>CSS pre-processors are all the rage these days, or so it would seem, but it can be a little complicated to get up and running with them, unless you’re using the right tools. Enter <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a>. This little app does pretty much everything from compiling LESS, SASS, HAML and CoffeeScript to optimising images and allowing you to import JavaScript files into each other.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/codekit.jpeg" alt="Codekit"></p>

<p>Since I started using <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> about six months ago I have been on the hunt for an app that can make the process of using it simple. That’s where CodeKit comes into it. Previously I had been using the <a href="http://incident57.com/less/">LESS app</a> and on a surface level found it worked well, but it was lacking a sense of intuitiveness. CodeKit just <em>knows</em> what I’m trying to do and doesn&rsquo;t require much in the way of configuration, at least where LESS is concerned.</p>

<p>I will be writing more about how we use CodeKit at Easyart in the future, but for now I will simply say that if you are at all involved in front-end development then you should check out it out as you will surely find it will improve your workflow and potentially make you more productive.</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 22 March 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p>For a number of years I&rsquo;ve really loved using <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> for team chat and collaboration, but today I&rsquo;ve cancelled our account. I&rsquo;ve found that as time has gone on, and our team has grown, it&rsquo;s become increasingly frustrating to use. My main issues are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The timeline ends up with too much noise from Github commits and issues.</li>
<li>Search is clunky. You can only search using keywords, and you have to leave the room to do so.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.flowdock.com/">Flowdock</a> solves these problems by using one pane for chat, and another for &ldquo;Team Inbox&rdquo; and Search.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/flowdock.png" alt="Flowdock"></p>

<p>Team Inbox is by far the most useful feature. We use it for:</p>

<ul>
<li>All Github activity. When new files are committed, you can mouse over for a full list of changes, and click to get to the Github commit page. When issues are opened or closed, they show too.</li>
<li>Inbox. We feed in the <a href="http://twitter.com/easyartuk">@easyartuk</a> Twitter account (you can see one of the tweets in the bottom-right corner), and all emails to our developer account, and they&rsquo;ll show up in our feed.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can also comment on any of this activity contextually. So, for instance, I could comment on an email. Search is also really cool too, and you can filter by files, links, and attachments. <em>Without</em> leaving the chat.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a really useful tool for us, and I can&rsquo;t see us going back to Campfire.</p>
