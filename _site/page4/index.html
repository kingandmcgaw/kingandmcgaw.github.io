      <p class="updated">Posted on 21 October 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p>This week thousands fellow web makers, CEOs, VCs and geeks descended on Dublin for the Dublin Web Summit. They had done an amazing job of promoting the event &ndash; there were flags on the mains streets, front-page coverage in papers and loads of media reporting live from the event (to the point where the wifi was almost useless!). The event itself had four stages, an expo room with startups from all over the world, and startup pitching stages. The overall highlight had to be DWS By Night, where they had taken over a whole street of pubs and clubs with free drinks for attendees. There were bound to be some sore heads on Thursday morning!</p>

<h3>Startup pitching stages</h3>

<p>Though the calibre of speakers on the stages was second to none (in Europe at least), I spent a lot of time on the startup pitching stages seeing what was happening in the startup world. Some highlights from the pitching stages and stands:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.copygr.am/">Copygr.am</a>. Tools for Instagram, and photographic prints. The design is lovely, but the prints are too expensive.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fabsie.com/">Fabsie</a>. Designer flatpack furniture manufactured on demand from crowdsourced manufacturers. I was really impressed by this but wonder how far they can go with the aesthetic they are locked into with laser cut wood.</li>
<li><a href="http://resumup.com/">Resump</a>. &ldquo;ResumUp is a service which shows you who and what you need to know to achieve all your career goals.&rdquo; It helps you visualise your skills and connects you with people who are already in your network to progress your career.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.atooma.com/">Atoomba</a>. Basically IFTT for your (Android) mobile.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.smartthings.com/">Smart Things</a>. These guys won the pitching competition for their impressive system to connect devices to the internet. This (or something like it) is going to be a big deal.</li>
<li><a href="https://tictail.com/">Tictail</a>. Quick and easy online stores with a killer UI. I tried it out and had as store online in 2minutes, and actually enjoyed the process. The resulting stores are just OK but the creation process is really impressive.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Chris Poole 4chan, Founder</h3>

<p>The subheading of this talk was something like <em>how I unwittingly became a sysadmin</em>, and was a story of how 4chan serves 600m page views a month and 1m new posts a day on five second-hand servers &ndash; each of which is a single point of failure &ndash; and no full-time staff.</p>

<p>By looking at the numbers that Google Analytics (which fires in the client via JavaScript) and Cloudflare (which was the entry point to the web request) were reporting, he realised that that half of their traffic was coming from web scrapers and third-party extensions, so it was only then that they added an API (which now serves 50m requests a day).</p>

<p>This was a really interesting talk with some refreshingly honest views, but it does go against a lot of things I believe as a software engineer, and I very much doubt that he has taken the same approach with his VC-funded startup <a href="http://canv.as/">Canv.as</a></p>

<h3>Curating the e-commerce revolution</h3>

<p>A panel discussion with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chris Morton, Ceo &amp; Co-Founder of Lyst</li>
<li>Diego Berdakin, President of BeachMint</li>
<li>Shauna Mei, Founder AHAlife.com</li>
<li>Carl Fritjofsson, Co-Founder &amp; COO Wrapp</li>
<li>Olivia Gossett, founder of ILWYW.com</li>
</ul>


<p>The basic theme of the discussion was that in online fashion retail, customers expect recommendations and a back-story (and increasingly customisation) in order to connect with the product. There seemed to be general agreement that the Net a Porter &ldquo;shop the story&rdquo; approach is a model that works well.</p>

<p>Amazon&rsquo;s approach is to fulfil commands (you search for TVs, you get TVs), but is terrible for serendipitous discovery. &ldquo;You never go to a grocery store and bring back only what was on your list&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Serendipity through content. Create desire through stories and context.</p>

<p><a href="http://new.livestream.com/websummit/DWS12Main/videos/4985557">Here&rsquo;s a recording</a> of the panel (watch from 1:47:40)</p>

<h3>More highlights in brief</h3>

<ul>
<li>The BBC&rsquo;s Chief Architect, News and Knowledge Gary O'Connor on BBC&rsquo;s dipping their toe in the water of cloud computing. An interesting perspective on the challenges in selling it into ops (they had no choice really, because they had to scale to accommodate London 2012 coverage), selecting a provider (AWS).</li>
<li>Mike McCue, Founder and CEO of Flipboard with MG Siegler, TechCrunch. I didn&rsquo;t really consider Flipboard to be important to publishing, but I have changed my mind now.</li>
<li>Mozilla Chairman Mitchell Baker provided some interesting insights into the state of the web at the moment and Mozilla&rsquo;s mission to keep it open.</li>
<li>Patrick Collison from Stripe was really interesting talk about how they got started, their challenges and growth.</li>
</ul>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 05 October 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p>I&rsquo;m just back from <a href="http://webperfdays.org/">WebPerfDays</a> at Facebook&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/facebooklondon">London engineering offices</a> in Covent Garden. It was a really great day out, with some great presenters.</p>

<p>A few notes&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.webperformancetoday.com/">Joshua Bixby</a> is a really good presenter and I&rsquo;ll be following his blog.</li>
<li>Not all performace stats apply to all companies. There were several examples cited of how reducing page load time had either no discernable effect, or even a negative impact (though they were very specific cases).</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mortal companies&rdquo; have different problems to the Googles, Facebooks and Amazons of the world.</li>
<li>Using a CDN doesn&rsquo;t guarantee those assets are delivered to the user faster. Our measurements would suggest otherwise, but a second look at the data would be wise.</li>
<li>97% of mobile response time is on the front end!</li>
<li>I like the concept of a &ldquo;poverty line&rdquo; in performance. i.e. if a metric is below a certain threshold it&rsquo;s &ldquo;poor&rdquo;.</li>
<li>A significant percentage of mobile users prefer the full site rather than a mobile version.</li>
<li>Simply cleaning up code and doing all the things you already know you should be doing will get you 80% of the way to where you need to get to with front-end code.</li>
<li>We should check out <a href="http://www.writegoodcode.com/">writegoodcode.com</a>.</li>
<li>After you optimise your front-end code, you have to be be vigilant about maitaining the gains you have made.</li>
<li>Other people probably have more difficult performance problems to solve than us. Seatwave have to cope for massive (60x) request peaks in requests in a matter of seconds (i.e. when their TVC is aired in the middle of X-Factor or a new concert goes on sale).</li>
<li>We should take a close look on the performance of our third party dependencies. They are generally recognised as evil when it comes to web performance.</li>
<li>Lonely Planet have a really great DevOps culture in their company (see their (dev blog)[http://devops.lonelyplanet.com/]) where metrics are king and web performance is recognised as a priority throughout the whole organisation. * They have gone some way to replacing “HiPPO” (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion) with real data.</li>
<li>Webpagetest.org is a tool that a lot of web performance experts seem to refer to.</li>
<li>Facebook have problems that are extremely unique, and fascinating from an observer&rsquo;s standpoint, but intimidatingly complex from a developer&rsquo;s. Sławek Biel did a really interesting presentation about how Facebook optimises its data access.</li>
<li>Overall, it&rsquo;s just reminded me that we need to continue to focus on performance as part of what we do.</li>
</ul>


<p>Update: Some of the presentations are <a href="http://www.seriticonsulting.com/blog/2012/10/8/webperfdays-summary-and-slides.html">now available online</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/2012/08/01/basecamp-at-easyart">Basecamp at Easyart</a></h2>
      <p class="updated">Posted on 01 August 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/basecamp.jpg" alt="Basecamp"></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re big fans of <a href="http://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> here at Easyart. It&rsquo;s very close to replacing email for our internal discussions. Here&rsquo;s what we like:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s open.</strong> I might have a discussion with one person, but others can be aware of what&rsquo;s going on by overhearing the discussion in the project or in the daily recap. It&rsquo;s also easy to see who is over subscribed.</li>
<li><strong>Distance is less important.</strong> We have two sites, numerous people that work from home, and a number of contractors. Using Basecamp is our primary means of communication makes collaboration more effective no matter where you are located.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s incredibly simple and fun to use.</strong> It does a small amount of things – to-dos, text documents, discussions, files – really well (we use Google for calendars). I had been meaning to write an internal document on how to use Basecamp but it has never been necessary!</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s totally usable by email only.</strong> Some of our busier people use it purely through email, while others use a combination of online and email.</li>
</ul>


<p>A few things would make it even more useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mentions.</strong> Sometimes the amount of email Basecamp generates is overwhelming, and unless you are assigned to a task you might never know that someone is waiting for a response from you.</li>
<li><strong>A proper CalDAV calendar.</strong> We need to be able to create events from other apps and devices if the calendar is going to be useful for us.</li>
<li><strong>A way to &ldquo;loop in&rdquo; other collaborators into a task or discussion, on the site.</strong> The only way to do this at the moment is to loop them in on email only.</li>
<li><strong>Chat integration.</strong> We <a href="http://easyartdevelopers.posterous.com/goodbye-campfire-hello-flowdock">switched from Campfire to Flowdock</a> back in March, but because most of the action is now in Basecamp, we don&rsquo;t use chat as much. It would be nice to be able to send one-liners in Basecamp without starting new discussions.</li>
</ul>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 02 June 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Colinstrong">Colin Strong</a> from <a href="http://www.gfk.com/">GfK</a> did a great presentation at <a href="http://digitalshoreditch.com/">Digital Shoreditch</a> yesterday on behavioural economics called <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/colinstrong/jam-sandwiches-final">The lesson of jam sandwiches for service developers and marketeers</a> which ties in with a lot of things we&rsquo;ve been discussing internally. Here are my takeaways:</p>

<h3>Avoid choice overload</h3>

<p>In the Jam sandwich study, customers were presented with 24 jams, which resulted in a 3% takeup. When the number of jams was reduced to 6, the takeup jumped to 30%. Reduce choice to increase conversions.</p>

<h3>Decoy options</h3>

<p>Introducing options in a product mix can have an effect on the percieved value of the other options. As an example, when consumers were shown three options for Economist subscriptions&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Online only for $59</li>
<li>Print only for $125</li>
<li>Print and online for $125</li>
</ol>


<p>&hellip;nobody picked option 2 and 84% choose option 3. That&rsquo;s because option 2 is acting as a decoy option 3 more attractive. When option 2 was removed, only 32% selected Option 3.</p>

<h3>Encourage a sense of ownership</h3>

<p>Once consumers feel they own an item they are reluctant to part with it. On Ebay, the highest bidder often starts thinking about possessing item, leading to more aggressive bidding. Amazon Prime’s limited trial makes customers focus on what they will lose if they cancel their subscription.</p>

<h3>Social influence</h3>

<p>Consumers are hugely influenced by the behaviour of others. Stock levels create a fear of missing out. I also think that positive social reinforcement &ndash; showing that other &ldquo;real&rdquo; people are buying an item &ndash; can be a huge influence also.</p>

<h3>Create magic moments</h3>

<p>Overall assessment is not key, only if the customer had a very positive or very negative experience. Create &ldquo;positive peaks&rdquo; through magic moments to leave a positive impression. Add something for free. It&rsquo;s inexpensive and has a disproportionate impact on satisfaction.</p>
