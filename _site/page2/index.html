    </header>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve been doing some restructuring here at Easyart, in order to set up a more Git-centric workflow for deployments. We wanted to make sure that we had some tests which would help us spot any problems while we made the transition.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m relatively comfortable with Rspec, so it was a natural starting point. But given that the sites themselves aren&rsquo;t built in Ruby, I&rsquo;m using Rspec to power Selenium Webdriver.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample test:</p>

<p>[GIST]</p>

<p>The Selenium::WebDriver object makes writing these tests pretty simple. These are the main methods we use:</p>

<ul>
<li>find_element and find_elements</li>
<li>get (or navigate.to, which I think are identical)</li>
<li>title</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it! These are the methods in the Selenium::WebDriver::Element object we are making the most use of:</p>

<ul>
<li>text</li>
<li>click</li>
<li>send_keys</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s an example which makes use of these:</p>

<p>[GIST]</p>

<p>One thing that took some getting used to was using the Selenium::WebDriver::Wait object. When you do a click, you have to tell Selenium you want to wait for a certain condition to be true before moving on to the next live of code.</p>

<p>In this example, I&rsquo;m waiting until the H1 tag contains the word &ldquo;cart&rdquo;:</p>

<p>[GIST]</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m used Rspec for unit and request specs, but it&rsquo;s advantageous to use a visible browser for this type of testing, as sometimes you can spot things with your eye that your tests won&rsquo;t. Then you write the test to catch it.</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 27 April 2012 by Steve Rydz</p>

    <p>Sublime Text 2 has been my text editor of choice for almost a year now but as I find myself working from the command line more and more these days, I thought I’d share a quick tip I picked up from Nick, opening files from the command line.</p>

<h3>Getting set up</h3>

<p>To begin with, we need to ensure that the bin directory is specified in our path. Just paste the following into Terminal:</p>

<p>[GIST]</p>

<p>Next up, we need to create the subl command. To do that just paste the following into Terminal:</p>

<p>[GIST]</p>

<p>To make sure this is working, just type subl into Terminal and press enter. If you’ve followed the steps above then that should open up Sublime.</p>

<h3>Using the command</h3>

<p>We’ve already seen how the subl command can be used to open Sublime itself, however it can also be used to open files and directorys, among other things.</p>

<p>This command opens a directory called mySite:</p>

<p>[GIST]</p>

<p>This command opens a file from the above directory called index.html:</p>

<p>[GIST]</p>

<h3>Taking it further</h3>

<p>This only scratches the surface of what you can do with this type of command. To see other actions available, try typing subl &mdash;help into Terminal and pressing enter. This will give you a list of ways to use this command.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This post is pretty much lifted from a post I wrote on my own blog last night:</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/2012/04/19/codekit-tip-export-project-settings">Codekit tip: Export project settings</a></h2>
      <p class="updated">Posted on 19 April 2012 by Steve Rydz</p>
    </header>
    <p>A few weeks ago I wrote about <a href="/2012/03/23/getting-to-know-codekit">getting to know CodeKit</a>. As a team, we have been using this tool solidly since then and it is now hard to imagine not working without it.</p>

<p>We did have a couple of issues with it though. The first was that everytime we updated the app, we had to set up our project again. This has been fixed in a recent release.</p>

<p>The other issue was that when working as a team, we had to ensure that we all had the exact same set-up. CodeKit is very intelligent and recognised what we were trying to acheive most of the time but we still found ourselves having to update output directories etc.</p>

<p>As it turns out, there was one simple solution to both of these problems. It is possible to export a config file for each project with it’s settings. This file lives in the root directory of your project and every time you drag a project into CodeKit, it looks for this file automatically.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/codekit-2.png" alt="Codekit"></p>

<p>To export the configuration file, simply highlight the project you are currently working on, right click on it, hover over the ‘Project settings’ menu, then click ‘Export project configuration file’. CodeKit will then place that file in the root directory of your project. That’s all there is to it.</p>

<p>This approach has worked really well for us and taken the burden of having to constantly ensure we are all doing the same thing away from us. The other great thing about this is that we now have this config file in our GIT repository.</p>

<p>All we have to do if we change the way our project is set up or introduce something new is to export another file and because we are using GIT, we will all get the latest file when we pull down the latest code.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to the CodeKit website, the free, BETA version of the app expires tomorrow (20th April, 2012), and I have heard rumours that it will be on sale via the app store for around $20. This app is more than worth that amount and if this is the case, I will certainly be purchasing a license first thing.</p>

    <p>I read a thought-provoking comment today on <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/3/26/7-years-of-youtube-scalability-lessons-in-30-minutes.html">High Scalability</a> that got me thinking. It appeared in a post which attempted to sum up &ldquo;<a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/3/26/7-years-of-youtube-scalability-lessons-in-30-minutes.html">7 Years of YouTube Scalability Lessons in 30 Minutes</a>&rdquo;. It shows a neat little trick that you can use to make it appear to the user that your site is faster than it really is. Read on&hellip;</p>

<h3>Approximate Correctness &ndash; Cheat a Little</h3>

<blockquote><p>A real world example. If you write a comment and someone loads the page at the same time, they might not get it for 300-400ms, the user who is reading won’t care. The writer of the comment will care, so you make sure the user who wrote the comment will see it. So you cheat a little bit. Your system doesn’t have to have globally consistent transactions. That would be super expensive and overkill. Not every comment is a financial transaction. So know when you can cheat.</p></blockquote>

<p>So basically you would update the page DOM in real-time, but send the actual comment post operation behind the scenes. It can take as long as it needs to complete. But in the meantime the commenter is happy to have such a quick experience. It&rsquo;s a win-win!</p>

<p>High Scalability is a blog that exposes the architecture of some very well-known and highly trafficked  websites. The posts are often written by the developers of those systems. So if you&rsquo;ve ever wondered how <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/12/19/how-twitter-stores-250-million-tweets-a-day-using-mysql.html">Twitter stores 250,000,000 tweets a day</a> using MySql (no NoSql here), then H.S. is the blog for you.</p>

    <p>It wasn’t that long ago when front-end development was considered to be nothing more than knowing HTML, CSS and jQuery. There wasn’t a great deal more to it, but the role has really developed over the past two years or so.</p>

<p>Yesterday I came across an article that does a great job of outlining what should be required of a front-end developer today. <a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers/">Go read it&hellip;</a></p>
