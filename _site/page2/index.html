    </header>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the <a href="http://artsy.github.com/">Art.sy engineering team&rsquo;s blog</a>. Their approach and <a href="http://artsy.github.com/blog/2012/10/10/artsy-technology-stack/">technology stack</a> are spookily similar to what we have in store for the next generation of the platform at Easyart. Even their blog runs on <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> just like this one!</p>

<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ve spent a fair bit of time on <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> this week. The question <a href="http://www.quora.com/Spotify/What-is-Spotifys-architecture">What is Spotify&rsquo;s architecture?</a> had an interesting answer from Spotify developer Niklas Gustavsson. They have around 100 backend services, most of which handle only a single task.</p>

<p>Paul Irish&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7AU2Ozu8eo">Javascript Development Workflow of 2013</a> has a lot of good tips. Things are moving so quickly in this space it&rsquo;s hard to keep up, so I find myself watching more and more presentations at home where I would have otherwise been watching TV.</p>

<p><a href="http://loopj.com/2012/12/07/http-headers-for-fun-and-profit/">HTTP Headers For Fun &amp; Profit</a> lists some interesting HTTP headers returned by popular sites.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a great post called <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/why-google-went-offline-today-and-a-bit-about">Why Google Went Offline Today and a Bit about How the Internet Works</a> over on the CloudFlare blog from a while back that sheds some light on how some of the underlying mechanics of the internetw work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2012/08/the-best-interface-is-no-interface.html/">The best interface is no interface</a> is very much an approach we are trying to head towards with some of the product customisation screens we&rsquo;ll launch in 2013. I&rsquo;m really excited about what next year has in store.</p>

<p>Finally, this post is my first one created and edited in <a href="http://prose.io/">Prose</a>. It&rsquo;s a really neat tool to create and edit code in Github repos in the browser, and is perfectly suited to (infact, created for) Jekyll blogs like this one.</p>

    <p>A humble prediction:</p>

<blockquote><p>Traffic to Easyart.com from 7" Android devices is going to have a noticeable bump after Christmas.</p></blockquote>

<p>Google and Amazon are both pushing their tablet products hard this gifting season, and both have pretty compelling products at a great price point. Even I – a dedicated Apple nut – have just bought a Nexus, and I&rsquo;m going to retire my first generation iPad to the giant eBay in the sky.</p>

<p>When the postman handed the package over, he said &ldquo;all I am doing is delivering Googles&rdquo;. That being the case, we&rsquo;d better get our skates on and set some new breakpoints in our responsive CSS!</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/2012/11/27/working-with-grunt">Working with Grunt</a></h2>
      <p class="updated">Posted on 27 November 2012 by Steve Rydz</p>
    </header>
    <p>A few weeks ago I attended a series of tooling workshops in Brighton. One of the workshops was focused around build process, and particularly <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a>.</p>

<p>Currently we use <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> to compile our Less and JavaScript files so we end up with concatenated, minified versions of each. So far this has worked well but we have found it difficult to keep things synchronised between team members.</p>

<p>Soon after returning from the workshops I started to investigate Grunt in more detail and we put a plan in place on how we could use it to aid our build process.</p>

<p>What we came up with was the following file structure:</p>

<pre><code>    Site_Name/
        |__ public/
        |           |__ static/
        |           |           |__ css/
        |           |           |__ js/
        |           |           |__ img/
        |           |
        |           |__ index.html
        |
        |__ spec/
        |
        |__ static-src/
        |           |__ less/
        |           |__ js/
        |
        |__ grunt.js
        |__ README.md
</code></pre>

<h3>public</h3>

<p>The public directory contains anything public facing, including all static assets such as stylesheets, scripts and images. Anything in the <code>static/css/</code> and <code>static/js/</code> directories is compiled from <code>static-src/</code>.</p>

<h3>spec</h3>

<p>The spec directory contains our selenium tests.</p>

<h3>static-src</h3>

<p>This is where we keep all of our pre-compiled files.</p>

<h3>Compiling LESS</h3>

<p>Our Less files are broken down into modules. There is a master file that imports all dependencies. This master file is then compiled into CSS, minified and placed in the <code>static/css/</code> directory.</p>

<h3>Compiling JavaScript</h3>

<p>Just like our Less files, all our JavaScript is broken down into modules. These are then concatenated to a master JavaScript file which is placed in the <code>static/js/</code> directory. We also create a minified version for production which sits alongside the master file in the <code>static/js/</code> directory.</p>

<h3>Enter Grunt</h3>

<p>Grunt makes the process of performing all of the above tasks very simple. Everything is defined inside our <code>grunt.js</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>module.exports = function(grunt) {

  grunt.initConfig({
    lint: {
      files: ['static-src/js/*.js']
    },
    less: {
      development: {
        options: {
          paths: ['static-src/less/'],
          yuicompress: true
        },
        files: {
          'public/static/css/master.css': 'static-src/less/master.less'
        }
      }
    },
    concat: {
      dist: {
        src: [
          'static-src/js/lib/jquery/jquery.js',
          'static-src/js/lib/jquery/jquery.cookie.js',
          'static-src/js/app.js'
        ],
        dest: 'public/static/js/master.js'
      }
    },
    min: {
      dist: {
        src: 'public/static/js/master.js',
        dest: 'public/static/js/master.min.js'
      }
    },
    watch: {
      files: ['static-src/js/*.js', 'static-src/less/*.less'],
      tasks: 'default'
    }
  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-less');

  grunt.registerTask('default', 'lint less concat min');

};
</code></pre>

<h3>Extending Grunt</h3>

<p>Grunt is very extensible and here we are using it in it&rsquo;s most basic form using (with the exception of Less) only it&rsquo;s built-in tasks. The goal here was to become less reliant on a third-part app such as CodeKit in favour of a platform that we can easily build upon.</p>

<p>Going forward, this is likely to be the way we do things. We will no doubt build on this in time, making use of more advanced features, and maybe even build some tasks of our own, but even as it stands, this is a good position for us to be in.</p>

    <p>Outside of the madness that is Christmas season at Easyart Towers, here are a few nuggets I&rsquo;ve enjoyed on the interwebs this week.</p>

<ol>
<li>The animated and excitable <a href="http://addyosmani.com/">Addy Osmani</a>&rsquo;s talk on <a href="http://vimeo.com/52450814">The New And Improved Developer Toolbelt</a> from Fronteers 2012 outlines some interesting tools for modern front end development, but I don&rsquo;t see us using Yoeman anytime soon (it&rsquo;s too magic!).</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d seen this one before, and perhaps I am using it as a cheatsheet for his <a href="http://www.danpink.com/books/drive">book</a> that I haven&rsquo;t quite finished reading yet, but <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">Dan Pink&rsquo;s TED lecture</a> on the mismatch between what science knows about motivation and what business does is utterly fascinating.</li>
<li>Some useful links in <a href="http://ivanzuzak.info/2012/11/18/the-web-engineers-online-toolbox.html">The Web engineer&rsquo;s online toolbox</a> that I&rsquo;ll be sure to come back to</li>
<li>Another one I re-read is <a href="http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2012/08/evolution-of-soundclouds-architecture/">The evolution of SoundCloud&rsquo;s architecture</a> as it&rsquo;s relevant to some thinking I am doing at the moment.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m really excited about what&rsquo;s happening at <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">GDS</a>. It seems impossibly progressive for a government to assemble a really clever group of designers and (Ruby) developers to build a new integrated web platform, and to make the whole thing open source <a href="https://github.com/alphagov">and on Github</a>!</li>
<li>I could almost see this list of <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/09/useful-tech-talks-videos-web-conferences/">Useful Talks And Videos From Web Design Conferences</a> replacing TV for me for a while, if only by <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">Boxee</a> would switch back on!</li>

    <p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been enjoying a new video series from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers?feature=watch">Google Developers channel</a> called <strong>The Breakpoint</strong> with <a href="http://paulirish.com">Paul Irish</a> and <a href="http://addyosmani.com/">Addy Osmani</a>, which focuses on front-end developer tools.</p>

<p>So far there have been three episodes and I highly recommend checking them out:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktwJ-EDiZoU">Episode 1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXeWjWp-8Y&amp;feature=relmfu">Episode 2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=HijZNR6kc9A">Episode 3</a></li>
</ul>
