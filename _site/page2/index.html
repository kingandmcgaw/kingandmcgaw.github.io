    <p>A humble prediction:</p>

<blockquote><p>Traffic to Easyart.com from 7" Android devices is going to have a noticeable bump after Christmas.</p></blockquote>

<p>Google and Amazon are both pushing their tablet products hard this gifting season, and both have pretty compelling products at a great price point. Even I – a dedicated Apple nut – have just bought a Nexus, and I&rsquo;m going to retire my first generation iPad to the giant eBay in the sky.</p>

<p>When the postman handed the package over, he said &ldquo;all I am doing is delivering Googles&rdquo;. That being the case, we&rsquo;d better get our skates on and set some new breakpoints in our responsive CSS!</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 27 November 2012 by Steve Rydz</p>
    </header>
    <p>A few weeks ago I attended a series of tooling workshops in Brighton. One of the workshops was focused around build process, and particularly <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a>.</p>

<p>Currently we use <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> to compile our Less and JavaScript files so we end up with concatenated, minified versions of each. So far this has worked well but we have found it difficult to keep things synchronised between team members.</p>

<p>Soon after returning from the workshops I started to investigate Grunt in more detail and we put a plan in place on how we could use it to aid our build process.</p>

<p>What we came up with was the following file structure:</p>

<pre><code>    Site_Name/
        |__ public/
        |           |__ static/
        |           |           |__ css/
        |           |           |__ js/
        |           |           |__ img/
        |           |
        |           |__ index.html
        |
        |__ spec/
        |
        |__ static-src/
        |           |__ less/
        |           |__ js/
        |
        |__ grunt.js
        |__ README.md
</code></pre>

<h3>public</h3>

<p>The public directory contains anything public facing, including all static assets such as stylesheets, scripts and images. Anything in the <code>static/css/</code> and <code>static/js/</code> directories is compiled from <code>static-src/</code>.</p>

<h3>spec</h3>

<p>The spec directory contains our selenium tests.</p>

<h3>static-src</h3>

<p>This is where we keep all of our pre-compiled files.</p>

<h3>Compiling LESS</h3>

<p>Our Less files are broken down into modules. There is a master file that imports all dependencies. This master file is then compiled into CSS, minified and placed in the <code>static/css/</code> directory.</p>

<h3>Compiling JavaScript</h3>

<p>Just like our Less files, all our JavaScript is broken down into modules. These are then concatenated to a master JavaScript file which is placed in the <code>static/js/</code> directory. We also create a minified version for production which sits alongside the master file in the <code>static/js/</code> directory.</p>

<h3>Enter Grunt</h3>

<p>Grunt makes the process of performing all of the above tasks very simple. Everything is defined inside our <code>grunt.js</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>module.exports = function(grunt) {

  grunt.initConfig({
    lint: {
      files: ['static-src/js/*.js']
    },
    less: {
      development: {
        options: {
          paths: ['static-src/less/'],
          yuicompress: true
        },
        files: {
          'public/static/css/master.css': 'static-src/less/master.less'
        }
      }
    },
    concat: {
      dist: {
        src: [
          'static-src/js/lib/jquery/jquery.js',
          'static-src/js/lib/jquery/jquery.cookie.js',
          'static-src/js/app.js'
        ],
        dest: 'public/static/js/master.js'
      }
    },
    min: {
      dist: {
        src: 'public/static/js/master.js',
        dest: 'public/static/js/master.min.js'
      }
    },
    watch: {
      files: ['static-src/js/*.js', 'static-src/less/*.less'],
      tasks: 'default'
    }
  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-less');

  grunt.registerTask('default', 'lint less concat min');

};
</code></pre>

<h3>Extending Grunt</h3>

<p>Grunt is very extensible and here we are using it in it&rsquo;s most basic form using (with the exception of Less) only it&rsquo;s built-in tasks. The goal here was to become less reliant on a third-part app such as CodeKit in favour of a platform that we can easily build upon.</p>

<p>Going forward, this is likely to be the way we do things. We will no doubt build on this in time, making use of more advanced features, and maybe even build some tasks of our own, but even as it stands, this is a good position for us to be in.</p>

    <p>Outside of the madness that is Christmas season at Easyart Towers, here are a few nuggets I&rsquo;ve enjoyed on the interwebs this week.</p>

<ol>
<li>The animated and excitable <a href="http://addyosmani.com/">Addy Osmani</a>&rsquo;s talk on <a href="http://vimeo.com/52450814">The New And Improved Developer Toolbelt</a> from Fronteers 2012 outlines some interesting tools for modern front end development, but I don&rsquo;t see us using Yoeman anytime soon (it&rsquo;s too magic!).</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d seen this one before, and perhaps I am using it as a cheatsheet for his <a href="http://www.danpink.com/books/drive">book</a> that I haven&rsquo;t quite finished reading yet, but <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">Dan Pink&rsquo;s TED lecture</a> on the mismatch between what science knows about motivation and what business does is utterly fascinating.</li>
<li>Some useful links in <a href="http://ivanzuzak.info/2012/11/18/the-web-engineers-online-toolbox.html">The Web engineer&rsquo;s online toolbox</a> that I&rsquo;ll be sure to come back to</li>
<li>Another one I re-read is <a href="http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2012/08/evolution-of-soundclouds-architecture/">The evolution of SoundCloud&rsquo;s architecture</a> as it&rsquo;s relevant to some thinking I am doing at the moment.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m really excited about what&rsquo;s happening at <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">GDS</a>. It seems impossibly progressive for a government to assemble a really clever group of designers and (Ruby) developers to build a new integrated web platform, and to make the whole thing open source <a href="https://github.com/alphagov">and on Github</a>!</li>
<li>I could almost see this list of <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/09/useful-tech-talks-videos-web-conferences/">Useful Talks And Videos From Web Design Conferences</a> replacing TV for me for a while, if only by <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">Boxee</a> would switch back on!</li>

    <p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been enjoying a new video series from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers?feature=watch">Google Developers channel</a> called <strong>The Breakpoint</strong> with <a href="http://paulirish.com">Paul Irish</a> and <a href="http://addyosmani.com/">Addy Osmani</a>, which focuses on front-end developer tools.</p>

<p>So far there have been three episodes and I highly recommend checking them out:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktwJ-EDiZoU">Episode 1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXeWjWp-8Y&amp;feature=relmfu">Episode 2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=HijZNR6kc9A">Episode 3</a></li>
</ul>

      <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/2012/11/13/london-js---create-the-web">London JS - Create the web</a></h2>
      <p class="updated">Posted on 13 November 2012 by Steve Rydz</p>
    </header>
    <p>Last night I attended <a href="http://www.eventhandler.co.uk/events/londonjs-createtheweb">London JS — Create the web</a>, which was hosted at <a href="http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/">Forward Technology</a>.</p>

<p>The first talk was by <a href="http://javascriptplayground.com">Jack Franklin</a> and was called <em>Optimising JavaScript</em>.</p>

<p>It was only a short talk but Jack presented some interesting finds regarding how to do common things with JavaScript quickly. To see some examples of this <a href="http://jackfranklin.github.com/ldnjs-optimisation-talk/#/">go checkout his slides</a>.</p>

<p>The second talk was more of a presentation on some of Adobes new products by <a href="https://twitter.com/mchaize">Michael Chaize</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tpryan">Terrance Ryan</a>.</p>

<p>It really looks like Adobe have stepped up their game and are now developing more web focused tools. They seem to be doing a lot with animation, but from the sound of their laptop fans I&rsquo;m not sure the world is ready for that yet.</p>

<p>The two tools that impressed me were the yet-to-be-released <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow/">Reflow</a> and <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>.</p>

<p>Reflow is a responsive design application which allows you to set breakpoints and rearrange the design accordingly. Effectively you are editing DOM elements rather than Photoshop layers. I really think a tool like this will help get designers thinking responsively, causing us developers a few less headaches in the process.</p>

<p>Brackets is an open source HTML, CSS and JavaScript editor. It has been designed to be lightweight, front-end focused and extensible. It is built entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and therefore easy to customise and extend with your own plugins. One feature I particularly liked was the ability to select an element from a HTML file and edit the CSS properties for that element without opening another file.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I had to leave before <a href="https://twitter.com/sw12/">Sam Duttons</a> WebRTC talk so I can&rsquo;t say anything about that.</p>

<p>I did come away with a free <a href="https://www.foldable.me/">foldable me</a> which I did put together late last night but have yet to photograph.</p>
