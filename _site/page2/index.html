    <p>Recently we&rsquo;ve switched from FTP to git to deploy changes to our live sites. Here&rsquo;s what our workflow looks like for functional changes (content amends use steps1,2,5,7,8):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/git.jpg" alt="Git-based deploys"></p>

<ol>
<li>Make changes on VMs on develop branch</li>
<li>Commit and push develop branch to Github</li>
<li>Pull develop branch to staging server</li>
<li>Review changes</li>
<li>Merge develop into master</li>
<li>Run Selenium tests</li>
<li>Push master to Github</li>
<li>Pull master into live server</li>
</ol>


<p>By using a Git-centric workflow, it&rsquo;s easier to guarantee that each application is running the same code, and we have the added safety of being able to roll back to previous versions.</p>

<p>Pulling changes onto live websites with millions of daily visitors makes me a little nervous, so I&rsquo;ll usually use <em>git fetch</em> rather than <em>git pull</em>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch
</code></pre>

<p>Pulls the remote master branch into a branch in the local repository called origin/master.</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff --numstat master origin/master
</code></pre>

<p>Reports the affected files between master and the origin/master branch we pulled in the previous step.</p>

<p>  $ git merge master origin/master</p>

<p>Merges the origin/master branch into master.</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 01 May 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve been doing some restructuring here at Easyart, in order to set up a more Git-centric workflow for deployments. We wanted to make sure that we had some tests which would help us spot any problems while we made the transition.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m relatively comfortable with Rspec, so it was a natural starting point. But given that the sites themselves aren&rsquo;t built in Ruby, I&rsquo;m using Rspec to power Selenium Webdriver.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample test:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2566740.js"> </script>


<p>The Selenium::WebDriver object makes writing these tests pretty simple. These are the main methods we use:</p>

<ul>
<li>find_element and find_elements</li>
<li>get (or navigate.to, which I think are identical)</li>
<li>title</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it! These are the methods in the Selenium::WebDriver::Element object we are making the most use of:</p>

<ul>
<li>text</li>
<li>click</li>
<li>send_keys</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s an example which makes use of these:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2566849.js"> </script>


<p>One thing that took some getting used to was using the Selenium::WebDriver::Wait object. When you do a click, you have to tell Selenium you want to wait for a certain condition to be true before moving on to the next live of code.</p>

<p>In this example, I&rsquo;m waiting until the H1 tag contains the word &ldquo;cart&rdquo;:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2567891.js"> </script>


<p>I&rsquo;m used Rspec for unit and request specs, but it&rsquo;s advantageous to use a visible browser for this type of testing, as sometimes you can spot things with your eye that your tests won&rsquo;t. Then you write the test to catch it.</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 27 April 2012 by Steve Rydz</p>
    </header>
    <p>Sublime Text 2 has been my text editor of choice for almost a year now but as I find myself working from the command line more and more these days, I thought I’d share a quick tip I picked up from Nick, opening files from the command line.</p>

<h3>Getting set up</h3>

<p>To begin with, we need to ensure that the bin directory is specified in our path. Just paste the following into Terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "export PATH=~/bin:$PATH" &gt;&gt; ~/.profile
</code></pre>

<p>Next up, we need to create the subl command. To do that just paste the following into Terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl
</code></pre>

<p>To make sure this is working, just type subl into Terminal and press enter. If you’ve followed the steps above then that should open up Sublime.</p>

<h3>Using the command</h3>

<p>We’ve already seen how the subl command can be used to open Sublime itself, however it can also be used to open files and directorys, among other things.</p>

<p>This command opens a directory called mySite:</p>

<pre><code>$ subl ~/Documents/mySite
</code></pre>

<p>This command opens a file from the above directory called index.html:</p>

<pre><code>$ subl ~/Documents/mySite/index.html
</code></pre>

<h3>Taking it further</h3>

<p>This only scratches the surface of what you can do with this type of command. To see other actions available, try typing subl &mdash;help into Terminal and pressing enter. This will give you a list of ways to use this command.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This post is pretty much lifted from a post I wrote on my own blog last night:</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 19 April 2012 by Steve Rydz</p>
    </header>
    <p>A few weeks ago I wrote about <a href="/2012/03/23/getting-to-know-codekit">getting to know CodeKit</a>. As a team, we have been using this tool solidly since then and it is now hard to imagine not working without it.</p>

<p>We did have a couple of issues with it though. The first was that everytime we updated the app, we had to set up our project again. This has been fixed in a recent release.</p>

<p>The other issue was that when working as a team, we had to ensure that we all had the exact same set-up. CodeKit is very intelligent and recognised what we were trying to acheive most of the time but we still found ourselves having to update output directories etc.</p>

<p>As it turns out, there was one simple solution to both of these problems. It is possible to export a config file for each project with it’s settings. This file lives in the root directory of your project and every time you drag a project into CodeKit, it looks for this file automatically.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/codekit-2.png" alt="Codekit"></p>

<p>To export the configuration file, simply highlight the project you are currently working on, right click on it, hover over the ‘Project settings’ menu, then click ‘Export project configuration file’. CodeKit will then place that file in the root directory of your project. That’s all there is to it.</p>

<p>This approach has worked really well for us and taken the burden of having to constantly ensure we are all doing the same thing away from us. The other great thing about this is that we now have this config file in our GIT repository.</p>

<p>All we have to do if we change the way our project is set up or introduce something new is to export another file and because we are using GIT, we will all get the latest file when we pull down the latest code.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to the CodeKit website, the free, BETA version of the app expires tomorrow (20th April, 2012), and I have heard rumours that it will be on sale via the app store for around $20. This app is more than worth that amount and if this is the case, I will certainly be purchasing a license first thing.</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 17 April 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at ways to deploy our static assets to S3 as part of our Git workflow.</p>

<p>I want to be able to push to the master branch of a remote repo and have the changes deployed to S3, with predefined HTTP headers. Much like I&rsquo;m used to pushing to Heroku with git push heroku master.</p>

<p>There are probably plenty of ways to do it &ndash; mounting S3 through Fuse, running Webdav servers, using Capistrano etc &ndash; but I found them too overkill for our needs.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve ended up writing a simple deploy script which lives at the root of the repo which uses <a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd">s3cmd</a> to sync between the local file system and our S3 bucket. It&rsquo;s a snap to set up, and the result is a command that looks like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2404535.js"> </script>


<p>I store this file in the repo, so that each of us developers can execute it by just calling ./deploy.sh. As this process is outside of the Git workflow, I have to exclude the .git directory. Conveniently, s3cmd&rsquo;s format for excluding files is the same as Git&rsquo;s so you can pass in a .gitignore if you&rsquo;re using one.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a true Git deploy (though it could be called via a <a href="http://progit.org/book/ch7-3.html">Git Hook</a>), but still a pretty neat solution.</p>
