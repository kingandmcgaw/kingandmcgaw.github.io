    <p>A couple of weeks back, I was lucky enough to travel to Oxford to be amongst the 700 who attended jQueryUK&rsquo;s 2015 edition. My first time in attendance, and my first time in Oxford in fact. Being a relatively new UK resident, this was also a delightful opportunity to explore the city on what turned out to be the nicest Saturday of the year so far!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/jquk-2015.jpg" alt="Some of the action from the jQueryUK 2015 conference"></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/jquk">Hashtag jquk</a> kicked off at a very reasonable 9:30am on Friday with the man himself, <a href="https://twitter.com/davemethvin">Dave Methvin</a> (he runs jQuery or something) showing off some of the cool new stuff we can start taking advantage of in ES6, even if we have to support some browsers that are <a href="http://breakupwithie8.com/">lagging behind</a>.</p>

<p>Hot on his heels was the strapping <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">Mark Otto</a>, schooling us on the ins and outs of CSS organisation. As the current caretaker of the CSS at King &amp; McGaw, there were some great takeaways here and I&rsquo;d really recommend checking out the slides and the accompanying video.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just slide after slide of code all day though. There were plenty of great speakers just there to share the things they&rsquo;re most passionate about.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jennschiffer">Jenn Schiffer</a> spoke about the intersection of technology and art, something that we&rsquo;re obviously very excited about too. Jenn went about creating artworks in the styles of Mondrian, Magritte and Matisse using nothing more than JavaScript. They&rsquo;re all part of her <code>var t</code> initiative check it out at <a href="http://vart.institute/">http://vart.institute/</a>, yes that&rsquo;s a real TLD.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani">Addy Osmani</a> nearly had to be dragged off stage while introducing some great new additions to Chrome&rsquo;s dev tools. Things like the new colour picker, the animation helpers and the incredible Timeline Layers panel are going to be super useful for developers everywhere.</p>

<p>Through all of the technical talks, one thing shone through. Empathy. For users, customers, clients, coworkers. All of those that use the things we build. Improving performance shows respect for people&rsquo;s time. Improving security shows respect for people&rsquo;s safety. Improving usability and accessibility shows respect for people&rsquo;s varied and ranging abilities.</p>

<p>To wrap everthing up, <a href="https://twitter.com/benjaminbenben">Ben Foxall</a> did something on stage that can only be described as groundbreaking. Harnessing the power of all the devices in the room to create an immersive audiovisual experience piece. The audience gave a collective exhale and moved back into the main hall, where the night was filled with pizza, burritos, retro gaming and beers especially brewed by the sponsors.</p>

<p>A fantastic way to spend a Friday. 5 stars, would conf again.</p>

<p>Also, the <a href="http://jqueryuk.com/2015/videos.php">videos</a> for all of the talks have just been released. I&rsquo;m off to watch all the ones I missed in person.</p>

    <p>Here at Easyart we are obsessed with speed. We constantly monitor the website&rsquo;s dataflow from server response time all the way through to the end user experience. In our office, within view of the developers is a dashboard which immediately alerts us to any slowdowns or performance changes on the platform. <img src="/assets/img/posts/easyart-office.jpg" title="Performance dashboard @ Easyart.com offices"></p>

<p>We take advantage of the great tools provided by <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> and <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">webpagetest.org</a> and pipe them through a <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/">Geckoboard</a> dashboard.</p>

<p>During a recent &ldquo;speed-up sprint&rdquo; we got stuck in to the numbers to try and find where the bottlenecks were and what we could do to fix them. So we ran a few tests on one of our <a href="http://www.easyart.com/prints/anonymous/new-york-afternoon-light-104883">product pages</a> using various browsers in a few different locations around the world (thanks to webpagetest.org). The results showed that we should be focusing on front-end performance rather than the server/database/back-end (more on that later).
<img src="/assets/img/posts/wpt-before.png" title="webpagetest.org result (pre-optimisation)"></p>

<p>That waterfall chart certainly doesn&rsquo;t look like the work of a team who &ldquo;are obsessed with speed&rdquo;! Not to worry, that&rsquo;s the purpose of this exercise. So time to roll up our sleeves and find out just what&rsquo;s going on here. We try to adhere to best-practices by gzipping content, using a CDN for assets etc. But the problem turned out to be even more simple to diagnose.</p>

<h2>Requests!</h2>

<p>There were a whopping 140 requests with a total download size of 1.3MB. So it was decided that reducing these would give the biggest return on investment. It turns out that many of these requests were coming from 3rd party scripts which download further scripts and tracking images. In particular, the popular addthis.com sharing button was a serious offender. This information is good to know, but we can&rsquo;t just go removing things without a discussion with the marketing department first. So that will have to come later. Let&rsquo;s clean up our own back yard first.</p>

<h3>Images and lazy loading</h3>

<p>On our target page we are loading 16 &ldquo;related prints&rdquo; which means 16 requests. We decided to &ldquo;<a href="http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload">lazy load</a>&rdquo; them, meaning they won&rsquo;t download until the user scrolls down the page. Strictly this won&rsquo;t have any effect on total download size, but it will free up the user&rsquo;s bandwidth and CPU for other things. Such as the <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> app that powers this page.</p>

<h3>Backbone and lazy coding</h3>

<p>In the Backbone app we have a modal which displays a custom framing interface, complete with dozens of framing options. We were creating this view - and downloading the images it containted - every time the app booted. But not every visitor sees this modal, so why waste the bandwidth?</p>

<p>The reason for this oversight is because in a previous design, the custom framing module was on the page, seen by everyone. But later it was moved into a modal, and the code wasn&rsquo;t refactored with optimisation in mind. So by now creating the view on demand (user clicks the <strong>change frame</strong> option) we save a few more image requests. Lesson learned: when things change, clean up after yourself.</p>

<h3>Modals should only appear when requested</h3>

<p>Further down the page is more 3rd party code (ugh) which displays a widget of recent reviews. This code downloaded even more js code, some css and even a webfont! So we changed this to download on when requested (onClick). Then we found 2 more modals of our own that were hard-coded into every page waiting for someone to find the magic link that would spring them into life. It&rsquo;s easy to code, but not very efficient. These were also changed to onClick events.</p>

<h3>Sprite-ify all the things!</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/menu-themes.png" title="Theme images ready for sprite-ing">
The main &ldquo;mega menu&rdquo; for art Themes has 12 tiny thumbnails which represent each category. A prime candidate for a sprite sheet. This one change alone would save 11 requests at the cost of a slightly larger css file. But the trade-off is worth it. But why stop with these 12? We had a look at every site asset in the header/footer and elsewhere, and started adding them to the master sprite sheet. But as you may know, jpgs tend to be suited to photographic images and pngs work better for large blocks of colour and sometimes require transparency. So we decided to have the best of both worlds and make one of each (thank you <a href="https://github.com/jakesgordon/sprite-factory">Sprite Factory</a>). This means two sprite requests, but better optimisation of the images themselves. Not to mention the quality of the images won&rsquo;t suffer as much as they would if we tried to force a jpg-type image into a png.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>So what were the results of all this tuning and tweaking?

<h2>Unexpected win</h2>

<p>After the work was complete, tested and pushed to production and the victory celebration was about to start, we were alerted to the fact that Google Anlaytics wasn&rsquo;t happy with the page speed! How could this be? Well the timing of this news was just a coincidence since it had nothing to do with the recent changes. What G was <em>really</em> complaining about was server response time. Something we blissfully ignored for this project. So back to New Relic to find the source of the problem.</p>

<p>What happened next could fill an entire blog post, but the long and short of it is: The amazing &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/ohler55/oj">Oj Gem</a>&rdquo;! Over 100ms saved on each and every JSON request from our back-end service.

    <p>The great thing about being a web developer is that you get to learn new things all the time. This week, I learned something really simple, but it had a big impact:</p>

<p><em>iOS doesn&rsquo;t respect event bubbling without a cursor style!</em></p>

<p>This amazed me. We have what we like to call popovers in various places on our main site, similar to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers">these</a>. Ours differ, in that we have a fullscreen, transparent div positioned behind them so the user can close them by clicking anywhere on the page. I discovered this wasn&rsquo;t working in iOS.</p>

<p>The code looks something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;click&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;.popover-overlay&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;.popover-overlay&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">remove</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>


<p>There didn&rsquo;t seem to be anything wrong with the code and it worked everywhere else. We use similar looking code on other areas of the site and they were working in iOS. I was very confused at this point.</p>

<p>The difference between this specific example and the other places event bubbling is used was that the element we are targeting is not a link. It turns out that unless the element you are targeting has a cursor style applied, iOS won&rsquo;t respect event bubbling.</p>

<p>After all that head scratching, the fix turned out to be:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nc">.popover-overlay</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">cursor</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">pointer</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>


<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe this. Especially as there is no visible cursor on iOS anyway!</p>

    <p>We all make countless decisions every day when we work. Which <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/super-successful-companies">of the hundreds of reasonable things</a> in my list will provide the highest value? How am I going to find the best solution for our customers? How will we know if we have even solved the problem?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with every one of their interactions with you, your customers are constantly sending you signals that can be used to make better decisions. At Easyart we put a lot of effort into basing our decisions on data first, and opinions second. As Jim Barksdale, former CEO of Netscape famously said:</p>

<blockquote><p>If we have data, let’s look at data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine.</p></blockquote>

<p>This post is about building better experiences for our customers through research and testing.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<h3>Customer research</h3>

<p>We must understand our customers in order to solve problems for them.</p>

<h4>Daily survey</h4>

<p>Our brilliant customer service team phones a small handful of customers and asks them five questions. The answers are recorded in a Google Doc.</p>

<p>Though it&rsquo;s a small sample size, it provides useful qualitative information which helps us spot patterns in individual customer stories in a way that we could never get from an Analytics funnel or aggregate market report.</p>

<h4>Market research</h4>

<p>Periodically we conduct large-scale market research which provides us with aggregate information on our customer demographic. These are less frequent but a much higher sample size than our daily surveys.</p>

<h3>Google Analytics, KISSmetrics, Crazy Egg and custom reporting</h3>

<p>We use Google Analytics (from here on, GA) and KISSmetrics (from here on, KM) extensively to find out how our customers are interacting with our site.</p>

<h4>Do and measure</h4>

<p>Some things are not A/B testable, we don&rsquo;t want to clog up the testing queue, or we&rsquo;re confident enough about our hypothesis that we will accept measuring after it&rsquo;s launched.</p>

<p>For every significant feature we create a GA annotation so we can do before-and-after analysis to check that everything went as expected. GA and KM provide different vantage points (<em>GA tells you what’s happening. KM tells you who’s doing it</em>), and we also use Crazy Egg for heatmap and scroll tracking.</p>

<p>We track click events on most of the elements we care about, so we can understand how users are using the site.</p>

<h4>Funnels</h4>

<p>Funnels are ways of modelling a user&rsquo;s journey through the key parts of your site. We keep a regular eye on these to try to identify under-performing steps that might represent problems or opportunities.</p>

<h4>Custom reporting</h4>

<p>To find out very specific answers, we’ll run custom reports which might involve data wrangling in SQL or Excel. For example: finding out the average number of line items in our abandoned baskets, understanding the relative performance of the main navigation vs the various search functions or customers’ tendency to frame their print relative to the size of the print.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<h3>UserTesting.com</h3>

<p>We use <a href="http://www.usertesting.com">Usertesting.com</a> to conduct remote user interviews. These allow us to observe people using the site as they follow a list of tasks. It gives us the &ldquo;why&rdquo; that is difficult to measure through metrics alone, and we predominantly use it to validate new UX ideas, as well as occasional competitor comparisons.</p>

<h4>Watch the videos together as a team and share your findings.</h4>

<p>It can be <em>extremely humbling</em> to you find out your brilliant idea makes no sense to the user, but it&rsquo;s better that these lessons are learned together.</p>

<h4>Test your iterations to gain confidence</h4>

<p>Google Ventures' Jake Knapp puts the emotional journey of user testing perfectly in <a href="http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-validateday5">this post</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>First session: “We’re geniuses!” or “We’re idiots!”</p>

<p>Sessions 2–4: “Oh, this is complicated…”</p>

<p>Studies 5-6: “There’s a pattern!”</p></blockquote>

<p>By running new tests with each of our major iterations we can see quick improvement which usually results in us building enough confidence to launch (though we occasionally reject ideas that don&rsquo;t test well).</p>

<h4>These are not real customers</h4>

<p>It should be noted that these are not your customers, nor are they in the same frame of mind that your customers will be, so don&rsquo;t treat this as customer research.</p>

<h3>A/B testing</h3>

<p>A/B testing can give us the <em>what</em> to the user testing&rsquo;s <em>why</em>, by providing a framework to validate a hypothesis.</p>

<p>Much has been written on the topic, and it&rsquo;s easy to believe it can be used to unearth hidden conversion opportunities <em>that will make you millions</em>. The truth is, not everything is suitable for A/B testing, and there is a fine art to planning tests properly.</p>

<h4>Start with a strong hypothesis</h4>

<p>Don&rsquo;t use a scattergun approach, this should be something you are confident about that is backed by data.</p>

<h4>Ensure that the hypothesis is testable.</h4>

<p>A good A/B testing candidate should be noticeable change, with decent traffic and an expectation for a double-digit improvement to a metric close to the area you are affecting (i.e. don&rsquo;t expect a change on your category page will have a measurable effect on overall conversion through your checkout).</p>

<p>We usually calculate the test plan using something like <a href="http://www.experimentcalculator.com/">experimentcalculator.com</a></p>

<h4>Agree the success metric upfront.</h4>

<p>Don&rsquo;t leave it open to interpretation, don&rsquo;t let ego get in the way, and <em>be willing to lose</em>. The truth can be humbling.</p>

<h4>Use more than one source of data.</h4>

<p>We use Optimizely to run the tests, but do most of our analysis through Google Analytics and KISSmetrics custom segments. This allows us to understand how users of each variation are behaving throughout their whole journey.</p>

<h3>Go with your gut</h3>

<p>We don&rsquo;t make <em>every</em> decision using data. Sometimes it just isn&rsquo;t possible, particularly with creative decisions, and in other times there isn&rsquo;t a lot that can be learned by analysis.</p>

<p>There is never absolute truth in numbers, and it&rsquo;s best to just <a href="http://www.gv.com/lib/design-instinct-vs-data">go with your instincts</a> and have the confidence to push forward.</p>

    <p>We&rsquo;re big fans of <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html">TDD</a> here at Easyart. So far this has only applied to our Ruby code, but with JavaScript increasingly becoming a bigger part of our technology stack, we needed to start testing that too.</p>

<h3>Choosing the right tool</h3>

<p>We chose <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html">Jasmine</a> as our testing framework, partly because of its similarity to RSPEC, and also because its really easy to get started with.</p>

<p>You can get started with Jasmine fairly quickly. Their <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/tree/master/dist">standalone distribution</a> has everything you need to get up and running. Opening the included <code>SpecRunner.html</code> will run the example tests and show you the results. From here you can swap out the example files with your own.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/jasmine-specrunner.png" alt="the Jasmine specrunner" /></p>

<h3>Getting up and running on Rails</h3>

<p>Once we settled on Jasmine, we needed a way to integrate it into our current workflow, as we don&rsquo;t want to be running tests manually all the time.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is an official <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-gem">Jasmine gem</a>. To add this to your project add the following to your gemfile:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="ss">group</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">development</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:test</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">&quot;jasmine&quot;</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>


<p>To setup the file structure that the gem expects for your tests, run the following command from your CLI, which will set up all the necessary files and directory structure to begin testing your code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">rails</span> <span class="n">g</span> <span class="ss">jasmine</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">install</span></code></pre></div>


<h3>Running the tests</h3>

<p>There are two ways you can run your Jasmine tests. The first is to run the following rake task:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">rake</span> <span class="n">jasmine</span></code></pre></div>


<p>This will fire up a web server, accessible at <code>localhost:8888</code> where you will see an HTML document displaying the results of your tests.</p>

<p>You can also run the tests in continuous integration mode from the command line, which will show you the results in the terminal:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">rake</span> <span class="ss">jasmine</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">ci</span></code></pre></div>


<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/jasmine-cli-specrunner.png" alt="the Jasmine CLI specrunner" /></p>

<h3>Writing the tests</h3>

<p>As I mentioned before, Jasmine is easy to get started with, as long as you are reasonably comfortable with JavaScript, but if like me, you&rsquo;re new to writing tests it can be hard to figure out where to start.</p>

<p>The key is to write code that is actually testable. The simplest way to do that is to ensure your code returns something. I attended a testing workshop a little over a year ago with <a href="http://rmurphey.com">Rebecca Murphey</a>, and she described this as:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Things don&rsquo;t do things - things announce things&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>She also advised to have the following question in mind when writing tests:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Given this input, do I get this output?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>For more on testable JavaScript, I recommend starting with <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/writing-testable-javascript">Rebecca&rsquo;s A List Apart article</a>.</p>

<h3>Going forwards</h3>

<p>So far we don&rsquo;t have as much JavaScript code coverage as we would like, but  with a little discipline we&rsquo;ll eventually get to a place where we can be confident that our code is always working.</p>
