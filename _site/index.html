    <p>We&rsquo;re big fans of <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html">TDD</a> here at Easyart. So far this has only applied to our Ruby code, but with JavaScript increasingly becoming a bigger part of our technology stack, we needed to start testing that too.</p>

<h3>Choosing the right tool</h3>

<p>We chose <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html">Jasmine</a> as our testing framework, partly because of its similarity to RSPEC, and also because its really easy to get started with.</p>

<p>You can get started with Jasmine fairly quickly. Their <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/tree/master/dist">standalone distribution</a> has everything you need to get up and running. Opening the included <code>SpecRunner.html</code> will run the example tests and show you the results. From here you can swap out the example files with your own.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/jasmine-specrunner.png" alt="the Jasmine specrunner" /></p>

<h3>Getting up and running on rails</h3>

<p>Once we settled on Jasmine, we needed a way to integrate it into our current workflow, as we don&rsquo;t want to be running tests manually all the time.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is an official <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-gem">Jasmine gem</a>. To add this to your project add the following to your gemfile:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="ss">group</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">development</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:test</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">&quot;jasmine&quot;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>To setup the file structure that the gem expects for your tests, run the following command from your CLI, which will set up all the necessary files and directory structure to begin testing your code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">rails</span> <span class="n">g</span> <span class="ss">jasmine</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">install</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h3>Running the tests</h3>

<p>There are two ways you can run your Jasmine tests. The first is to run the following rake task:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">rake</span> <span class="n">jasmine</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>This will fire up a web server, accessible at <code>localhost:8888</code> where you will see an HTML document displaying the results of your tests.</p>

<p>You can also run the tests in continuous integration mode from the command line, which will show you the results in the terminal:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">rake</span> <span class="ss">jasmine</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">ci</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/jasmine-CLI-specrunner.png" alt="the Jasmine CLI specrunner" /></p>

<h3>Integrating into your build process</h3>

<p>Depending on your environment, you may have to add the <code>ci</code> rake task to your deployment process, but we currently use <a href="http://circleci.com">CircleCI</a> which picked it up automatically, which means our test run every time we deploy, and if they don&rsquo;t pass, the build will fail.</p>

<h3>Writing the tests</h3>

<p>As I mentioned before, Jasmine is easy to get started with, as long as you are reasonably comfortable with JavaScript, but if like me, you&rsquo;re new to writing tests it can be hard to figure out where to start.</p>

<p>The key is to write code that is actually testable. The simplest way to do that is to ensure your code returns something. I attended a testing workshop a little over a year ago with <a href="http://rmurphey.com">Rebecca Murphey</a>, and she described this as:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Things don&rsquo;t do things - things announce things&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>She also advised to have the following question in mind when writing tests:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Given this input, do I get this output?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>For more on testable JavaScript, I recommend starting with <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/writing-testable-javascript">Rebecca&rsquo;s A List Apart article</a>.</p>

<h3>Going forwards</h3>

<p>So far we don&rsquo;t have as much JavaScript code coverage as we would like, but  with a little discipline we&rsquo;ll eventually get to a place where we can be confident that our code is always working.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling to solve a problem for some time now. The agile (with a lower-case &ldquo;a&rdquo;) <a href="/2013/04/16/easyart-flavoured-agile/">approach</a> we use for software development and the long-term roadmaps we have as a business have always been too disconnected, but I never quite knew how to connect them.</p>

<p>Recently, inspired by a deeper understanding of the <a href="/2014/02/16/lean-ux-at-easyart/">lean approaches</a>, I think I&rsquo;ve finally connected them together in these five steps. It&rsquo;s still an emerging process, but I&rsquo;m hopeful it will solve a number of problems.</p>

<h3>Keep an inventory of hypotheses</h3>

<p>We all have ideas for ways to improve the site. Some of them are bound to make a positive difference, others will make the site worse, and most will have no measurable effect at all.</p>

<p>We keep a spreadsheet of these ideas, documented as hypotheses (if I do x, y will happen), along with as much additional information as we have. This ideas backlog becomes our ammunition to improve the site. Importantly, these are not added to Basecamp, where the tasks live until they have been prioritised.</p>

<h3>Establish themes</h3>

<p>In order to prioritise the ideas backlog, I work with other managers to decide on a theme for each month. To establish the theme we might look at under-performing parts of the conversion funnel, goals in other parts of the business, tech roadmap etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes the theme might be very specific (increase percentage of framed products sold), or more generic (increase AOV or improve funnel conversion for search, product, cart, order complete).</p>

<p>Rallying the team around a focussed goal helps us dive deeper into interconnected ideas. We spend 60% of our development time working on tasks related to the theme, while the other 40% is reserved for fixing bugs, cost of doing business tasks, documentation, research etc.</p>

<h3>Prioritise hypotheses around themes</h3>

<p>Once the theme is established, we hold a workshop to prioritise the hypotheses from the backlog in the ways most likely to improve the target KPI.</p>

<p>These competing ideas will vary wildly in difficulty and will probably contradict each another. Using experiment mapping and PIE ranking we can prioritise these based on value.</p>

<h3>Create tasks from prioritised hypotheses</h3>

<p>Once priorities are established, tasks are added to the &ldquo;Next up&rdquo; or &ldquo;Backlog&rdquo; lists in Basecamp, along with the corresponding hypothesis. Depending on our level of confidence in the task, we may use a combination of data analysis, user testing and competitor analysis to research the best solution.</p>

<p>Tasks move through a Kanban-esque process through &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; and &ldquo;QA&rdquo; through its lifecycle, collecting more and more information as it goes.</p>

<h3>Validate hypothesis</h3>

<p>Once in &ldquo;QA&rdquo;, a combination of user testing and split testing will be used to validate or invalidate our hypothesis.</p>

<p>Minor variations will take a long time to reach statistical confidence, so we only split test meaningful changes. We always agree on the measure of success upfront, but also cross-check side-effects with Analytics segments.</p>

<p>Once a conclusion is reached, the task is marked as complete, links to the task/discussion/tests added to the spreadsheet before it&rsquo;s moved to a &ldquo;completed tests&rdquo; sheet, and annotations added to Analytics for before-and-after analysis.</p>

<p>With each test, we increase our shared understanding of what our customers want, which in turn generates high quality ideas for future testing.</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/2014/02/17/a-somewhat-better-auto-complete-%28part-2%29">A somewhat better auto-complete (part 2)</a></h2>
      <p class="updated">Posted on 17 February 2014

    <p>This is part 2 of a post which tries to explain a method of enhancing an auto-complete search box to act in a similar way to the Google search box.
<a href="/2013/11/12/a-somewhat-better-autocomplete/">&raquo; Read part one here &laquo;</a></p>

<h2>A solution</h2>

<p>Something that would work perfectly for this style of query would be to use a regular expression query with a <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html">lookahead assertion</a>.</p>

<p>But wait, <em>MySQL doesn&rsquo;t support look(ahead|behind) assertions!</em>, I hear you say. That&rsquo;s ok, we&rsquo;ll do it the hard way, in code.</p>

<h2>The query</h2>

<p>First we need to mangle the input into a query that will get us most of the way using plain old sql. For example, if the user enters the string <strong>pcr</strong> (perhaps looking for the <strong>p</strong>rint <strong>c</strong>ategory <strong>r</strong>eport), we want to end up with the following:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sql"><span class="k">select</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">admin_pages</span> <span class="k">where</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">page_description</span> <span class="k">like</span> <span class="s1">&#39;%p%&#39;</span> <span class="k">and</span> 
    <span class="n">page_description</span> <span class="k">like</span> <span class="s1">&#39;%c%&#39;</span> <span class="k">and</span> 
    <span class="n">page_description</span> <span class="k">like</span> <span class="s1">&#39;%r%&#39;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>This will return all pages that have <strong>every</strong> one of those letters in the description in alphabetical order.</p>

<ul>
<li>/admin/<strong>p</strong>rint_<strong>c</strong>atego<strong>r</strong>ies.php</li>
<li>/admin/<strong>p</strong>rodu<strong>c</strong>t_sales_<strong>r</strong>eport.php</li>
<li>/admin/su<strong>p</strong>plier_sto<strong>c</strong>ked_item_<strong>r</strong>eport.php</li>
</ul>


<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem. The ordering of letters matters. We only want pages that contain a <strong>p</strong> followed by 0 or more letters, then a <strong>c</strong> followed by 0 or more letters, followed by an <strong>r</strong>. No matter, this will at least give us something to start with. It&rsquo;s better than stuffing the entire database table into memory for searching.</p>

<p>The code that constructs this query is below (I&rsquo;ve removed any security/sanitisation code to avoid cluttering up the example.):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">page_desc_sql</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$s</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;page_description like &#39;%</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="nv">$s</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">%&#39;&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// a-z only please...</span>
<span class="nv">$query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">preg_replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/[^a-z]/&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">strtolower</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_GET</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;q&quot;</span><span class="p">]));</span>

<span class="c1">// build query</span>
<span class="nv">$s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">implode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot; and &quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">array_map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;page_desc_sql&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">str_split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$query</span><span class="p">)));</span>

<span class="nv">$sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="s2">    select</span>
<span class="s2">        page_id,</span>
<span class="s2">        page_name,</span>
<span class="s2">        page_description</span>
<span class="s2">    from</span>
<span class="s2">        admin_pages</span>
<span class="s2">    where</span>
<span class="s2">        (</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="nv">$s</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">)</span>
<span class="s2">    order by page_description asc</span>
<span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>So now we have a list of pages ready to process. Let&rsquo;s create that lookahead expression.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">page_regex</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;(?=</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="nv">$x</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">).*&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nv">$regex</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nb">implode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">array_map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;page_regex&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">str_split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$query</span><span class="p">)))</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/i&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>This sets $regex to the string:<br/>
<strong>/(?=p).*(?=c).*(?=r).*/i</strong></p>

<p>The final piece of the puzzle is to take the results and pass them through this regex, only returning the ones that match. Then output some json for the auto-complete to use.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$q</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">next_record</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>

        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">preg_match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$regex</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;page_description&quot;</span><span class="p">]))</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <p>There is something of a revolution underway in the way that we approach user experience at Easyart. With <a href="http://easyart.github.io/2013/04/16/easyart-flavoured-agile/">Agile processes</a> so important to the way we build software, we felt we were ready to implement Lean UX approaches to help solve some of our user experience problems. It&rsquo;s early days but I thought I would share some of the things that have worked for us so far.</p>

<p><em>Note: I&rsquo;ve added some notes on this to the <a href="http://www.github.com/easyart/handbook">tech handbook</a> which is emerging at the moment, but I thought I would elaborate on some of the processes in this post.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://distilleryimage11.ak.instagram.com/6b11ac0a961a11e3b3ed0e5981f7b917_8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>Agree on outcomes before deciding on features</h3>

<p>By starting with a KPI we want to affect, we can develop hypotheses which we believe will help us reach that goal, and have a clear-cut way of measuring success.</p>

<h3>Use personas to guide decisions</h3>

<p>Focussing on user needs helps us build a more human experience so we have developed three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience">personas</a> which we can use to step through different on-site journeys.</p>

<p><img src="http://distilleryimage10.ak.instagram.com/48bd27167a5311e3b40d12f304019c2e_8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>Shared understanding and hypotheses over design heroes</h3>

<p>Getting stakeholders involved in the conception of ideas builds a shared understanding, which is invaluable for collaborating across departments and skill-sets. We&rsquo;ve had some success with <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/establishing-design-direction/">gut test exercises</a> when working on new homepage visual design, group sketching <a href="http://goodkickoffmeetings.com/2010/04/design-studioprototyping-exercise/">design studio</a> exercises to improve navigation and card sorting to agree on priorities.</p>

<h3>Use the live styleguide to build pages from modules</h3>

<p>Changing from a page-based approach to a component-based approach allows everyone to sketch pages, and our <a href="http://www.easyart.com/docs/styleguide">live style guide</a> is the directory of available modules.</p>

<h3>Validate as early as possible</h3>

<p>Our opinions are not as important as customer feedback, so we try to validate our hypotheses as early as possible. We use Usertesting.com for user testing, and Optimizely for split testing.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re at the formative stages of this process at the moment, but I&rsquo;m hopeful it&rsquo;s going to make a big difference.</p>

    <p>Our Wordpress blog is a useful tool for publishing marketing information and one we wanted to keep in our new site as it provides useful information for customers as well as helping to keep the content of the site fresh.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t necessarily want all the features of Wordpress so beloved of developers the world over, just the content posts, assets and a means of querying the different categories we&rsquo;d set up.</p>

<p>We used the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/">JSON_API</a> plugin to do the job. It installs into a wordpress instance and exposes a number of REST methods allowing our rails controller to fetch and parse the blog content efficiently (caching it for performance). The plugin doesn&rsquo;t include any authentication options but if you only enable the get methods it&rsquo;s no more public than a hosted Wordpress site.</p>

<p>There were a few small customizations to Wordpress we added - essentially to disable frontend access so that the content only appears in the context of our <a href="http://www.easyart.com/trends">main website</a>. Splitting the content management off into a separate service like this both fits with the SOA structure of Easyart and means our editors can add and edit content without affecting anything that might be happening on the rest of the platform.</p>
