    <p>I&rsquo;m just back from <a href="http://webperfdays.org/">WebPerfDays</a> at Facebook&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/facebooklondon">London engineering offices</a> in Covent Garden. It was a really great day out, with some great presenters.</p>

<p>A few notes&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.webperformancetoday.com/">Joshua Bixby</a> is a really good presenter and I&rsquo;ll be following his blog.</li>
<li>Not all performace stats apply to all companies. There were several examples cited of how reducing page load time had either no discernable effect, or even a negative impact (though they were very specific cases).</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mortal companies&rdquo; have different problems to the Googles, Facebooks and Amazons of the world.</li>
<li>Using a CDN doesn&rsquo;t guarantee those assets are delivered to the user faster. Our measurements would suggest otherwise, but a second look at the data would be wise.</li>
<li>97% of mobile response time is on the front end!</li>
<li>I like the concept of a &ldquo;poverty line&rdquo; in performance. i.e. if a metric is below a certain threshold it&rsquo;s &ldquo;poor&rdquo;.</li>
<li>A significant percentage of mobile users prefer the full site rather than a mobile version.</li>
<li>Simply cleaning up code and doing all the things you already know you should be doing will get you 80% of the way to where you need to get to with front-end code.</li>
<li>We should check out <a href="http://www.writegoodcode.com/">writegoodcode.com</a>.</li>
<li>After you optimise your front-end code, you have to be be vigilant about maitaining the gains you have made.</li>
<li>Other people probably have more difficult performance problems to solve than us. Seatwave have to cope for massive (60x) request peaks in requests in a matter of seconds (i.e. when their TVC is aired in the middle of X-Factor or a new concert goes on sale).</li>
<li>We should take a close look on the performance of our third party dependencies. They are generally recognised as evil when it comes to web performance.</li>
<li>Lonely Planet have a really great DevOps culture in their company (see their (dev blog)[http://devops.lonelyplanet.com/]) where metrics are king and web performance is recognised as a priority throughout the whole organisation. * They have gone some way to replacing “HiPPO” (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion) with real data.</li>
<li>Webpagetest.org is a tool that a lot of web performance experts seem to refer to.</li>
<li>Facebook have problems that are extremely unique, and fascinating from an observer&rsquo;s standpoint, but intimidatingly complex from a developer&rsquo;s. Sławek Biel did a really interesting presentation about how Facebook optimises its data access.</li>
<li>Overall, it&rsquo;s just reminded me that we need to continue to focus on performance as part of what we do.</li>
</ul>


<p>Update: Some of the presentations are <a href="http://www.seriticonsulting.com/blog/2012/10/8/webperfdays-summary-and-slides.html">now available online</a>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re big fans of <a href="http://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> here at Easyart. It&rsquo;s very close to replacing email for our internal discussions. Here&rsquo;s what we like:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s open.</strong> I might have a discussion with one person, but others can be aware of what&rsquo;s going on by overhearing the discussion in the project or in the daily recap. It&rsquo;s also easy to see who is over subscribed.</li>
<li><strong>Distance is less important.</strong> We have two sites, numerous people that work from home, and a number of contractors. Using Basecamp is our primary means of communication makes collaboration more effective no matter where you are located.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s incredibly simple and fun to use.</strong> It does a small amount of things – to-dos, text documents, discussions, files – really well (we use Google for calendars). I had been meaning to write an internal document on how to use Basecamp but it has never been necessary!</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s totally usable by email only.</strong> Some of our busier people use it purely through email, while others use a combination of online and email.</li>
</ul>


<p>A few things would make it even more useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mentions.</strong> Sometimes the amount of email Basecamp generates is overwhelming, and unless you are assigned to a task you might never know that someone is waiting for a response from you.</li>
<li><strong>A proper CalDAV calendar.</strong> We need to be able to create events from other apps and devices if the calendar is going to be useful for us.</li>
<li><strong>A way to &ldquo;loop in&rdquo; other collaborators into a task or discussion, on the site.</strong> The only way to do this at the moment is to loop them in on email only.</li>
<li><strong>Chat integration.</strong> We <a href="http://easyartdevelopers.posterous.com/goodbye-campfire-hello-flowdock">switched from Campfire to Flowdock</a> back in March, but because most of the action is now in Basecamp, we don&rsquo;t use chat as much. It would be nice to be able to send one-liners in Basecamp without starting new discussions.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Spotted this interesting piece on <a href="http://code.flickr.com/blog/2012/05/15/liquid-photo-page-layout/">Flickr&rsquo;s code blog</a> about the thought behind their new liquid photo page, which is very relevant to some of the things we are thinking about at the moment.</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 02 June 2012 by John Pash</p>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Colinstrong">Colin Strong</a> from <a href="http://www.gfk.com/">GfK</a> did a great presentation at <a href="http://digitalshoreditch.com/">Digital Shoreditch</a> yesterday on behavioural economics called <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/colinstrong/jam-sandwiches-final">The lesson of jam sandwiches for service developers and marketeers</a> which ties in with a lot of things we&rsquo;ve been discussing internally. Here are my takeaways:</p>

<h3>Avoid choice overload</h3>

<p>In the Jam sandwich study, customers were presented with 24 jams, which resulted in a 3% takeup. When the number of jams was reduced to 6, the takeup jumped to 30%. Reduce choice to increase conversions.</p>

<h3>Decoy options</h3>

<p>Introducing options in a product mix can have an effect on the percieved value of the other options. As an example, when consumers were shown three options for Economist subscriptions&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Online only for $59</li>
<li>Print only for $125</li>
<li>Print and online for $125</li>
</ol>


<p>&hellip;nobody picked option 2 and 84% choose option 3. That&rsquo;s because option 2 is acting as a decoy option 3 more attractive. When option 2 was removed, only 32% selected Option 3.</p>

<h3>Encourage a sense of ownership</h3>

<p>Once consumers feel they own an item they are reluctant to part with it. On Ebay, the highest bidder often starts thinking about possessing item, leading to more aggressive bidding. Amazon Prime’s limited trial makes customers focus on what they will lose if they cancel their subscription.</p>

<h3>Social influence</h3>

<p>Consumers are hugely influenced by the behaviour of others. Stock levels create a fear of missing out. I also think that positive social reinforcement &ndash; showing that other &ldquo;real&rdquo; people are buying an item &ndash; can be a huge influence also.</p>

<h3>Create magic moments</h3>

<p>Overall assessment is not key, only if the customer had a very positive or very negative experience. Create &ldquo;positive peaks&rdquo; through magic moments to leave a positive impression. Add something for free. It&rsquo;s inexpensive and has a disproportionate impact on satisfaction.</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 21 May 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p>Recently we&rsquo;ve switched from FTP to git to deploy changes to our live sites. Here&rsquo;s what our workflow looks like for functional changes (content amends use steps1,2,5,7,8):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/git.jpg" alt="Git-based deploys"></p>

<ol>
<li>Make changes on VMs on develop branch</li>
<li>Commit and push develop branch to Github</li>
<li>Pull develop branch to staging server</li>
<li>Review changes</li>
<li>Merge develop into master</li>
<li>Run Selenium tests</li>
<li>Push master to Github</li>
<li>Pull master into live server</li>
</ol>


<p>By using a Git-centric workflow, it&rsquo;s easier to guarantee that each application is running the same code, and we have the added safety of being able to roll back to previous versions.</p>

<p>Pulling changes onto live websites with millions of daily visitors makes me a little nervous, so I&rsquo;ll usually use <em>git fetch</em> rather than <em>git pull</em>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch
</code></pre>

<p>Pulls the remote master branch into a branch in the local repository called origin/master.</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff --numstat master origin/master
</code></pre>

<p>Reports the affected files between master and the origin/master branch we pulled in the previous step.</p>

<p>  $ git merge master origin/master</p>

<p>Merges the origin/master branch into master.</p>
