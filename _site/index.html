    <p>The great thing about being a web developer is that you get to learn new things all the time. This week, I learned something really simple, but it had a big impact:</p>

<p><em>iOS doesn&rsquo;t respect event bubbling without a cursor style!</em></p>

<p>This amazed me. We have what we like to call popovers in various places on our main site, similar to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers">these</a>. Ours differ, in that we have a fullscreen, transparent div positioned behind them so the user can close them by clicking anywhere on the page. I discovered this wasn&rsquo;t working in iOS.</p>

<p>The code looks something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;click&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;.popover-overlay&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;.popover-overlay&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">remove</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>


<p>There didn&rsquo;t seem to be anything wrong with the code and it worked everywhere else. We use similar looking code on other areas of the site and they were working in iOS. I was very confused at this point.</p>

<p>The difference between this specific example and the other places event bubbling is used was that the element we are targeting is not a link. It turns out that unless the element you are targeting has a cursor style applied, iOS won&rsquo;t respect event bubbling.</p>

<p>After all that head scratching, the fix turned out to be:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nc">.popover-overlay</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">cursor</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">pointer</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>


<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe this. Especially as there is no visible cursor on iOS anyway!</p>

    <p>We all make countless decisions every day when we work. Which <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/super-successful-companies">of the hundreds of reasonable things</a> in my list will provide the highest value? How am I going to find the best solution for our customers? How will we know if we have even solved the problem?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with every one of their interactions with you, your customers are constantly sending you signals that can be used to make better decisions. At Easyart we put a lot of effort into basing our decisions on data first, and opinions second. As Jim Barksdale, former CEO of Netscape famously said:</p>

<blockquote><p>If we have data, let’s look at data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine.</p></blockquote>

<p>This post is about building better experiences for our customers through research and testing.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<h3>Customer research</h3>

<p>We must understand our customers in order to solve problems for them.</p>

<h4>Daily survey</h4>

<p>Our brilliant customer service team phones a small handful of customers and asks them five questions. The answers are recorded in a Google Doc.</p>

<p>Though it&rsquo;s a small sample size, it provides useful qualitative information which helps us spot patterns in individual customer stories in a way that we could never get from an Analytics funnel or aggregate market report.</p>

<h4>Market research</h4>

<p>Periodically we conduct large-scale market research which provides us with aggregate information on our customer demographic. These are less frequent but a much higher sample size than our daily surveys.</p>

<h3>Google Analytics, KISSmetrics, Crazy Egg and custom reporting</h3>

<p>We use Google Analytics (from here on, GA) and KISSmetrics (from here on, KM) extensively to find out how our customers are interacting with our site.</p>

<h4>Do and measure</h4>

<p>Some things are not A/B testable, we don&rsquo;t want to clog up the testing queue, or we&rsquo;re confident enough about our hypothesis that we will accept measuring after it&rsquo;s launched.</p>

<p>For every significant feature we create a GA annotation so we can do before-and-after analysis to check that everything went as expected. GA and KM provide different vantage points (<em>GA tells you what’s happening. KM tells you who’s doing it</em>), and we also use Crazy Egg for heatmap and scroll tracking.</p>

<p>We track click events on most of the elements we care about, so we can understand how users are using the site.</p>

<h4>Funnels</h4>

<p>Funnels are ways of modelling a user&rsquo;s journey through the key parts of your site. We keep a regular eye on these to try to identify under-performing steps that might represent problems or opportunities.</p>

<h4>Custom reporting</h4>

<p>To find out very specific answers, we’ll run custom reports which might involve data wrangling in SQL or Excel. For example: finding out the average number of line items in our abandoned baskets, understanding the relative performance of the main navigation vs the various search functions or customers’ tendency to frame their print relative to the size of the print.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<h3>UserTesting.com</h3>

<p>We use <a href="http://www.usertesting.com">Usertesting.com</a> to conduct remote user interviews. These allow us to observe people using the site as they follow a list of tasks. It gives us the &ldquo;why&rdquo; that is difficult to measure through metrics alone, and we predominantly use it to validate new UX ideas, as well as occasional competitor comparisons.</p>

<h4>Watch the videos together as a team and share your findings.</h4>

<p>It can be <em>extremely humbling</em> to you find out your brilliant idea makes no sense to the user, but it&rsquo;s better that these lessons are learned together.</p>

<h4>Test your iterations to gain confidence</h4>

<p>Google Ventures' Jake Knapp puts the emotional journey of user testing perfectly in <a href="http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-validateday5">this post</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>First session: “We’re geniuses!” or “We’re idiots!”</p>

<p>Sessions 2–4: “Oh, this is complicated…”</p>

<p>Studies 5-6: “There’s a pattern!”</p></blockquote>

<p>By running new tests with each of our major iterations we can see quick improvement which usually results in us building enough confidence to launch (though we occasionally reject ideas that don&rsquo;t test well).</p>

<h4>These are not real customers</h4>

<p>It should be noted that these are not your customers, nor are they in the same frame of mind that your customers will be, so don&rsquo;t treat this as customer research.</p>

<h3>A/B testing</h3>

<p>A/B testing can give us the <em>what</em> to the user testing&rsquo;s <em>why</em>, by providing a framework to validate a hypothesis.</p>

<p>Much has been written on the topic, and it&rsquo;s easy to believe it can be used to unearth hidden conversion opportunities <em>that will make you millions</em>. The truth is, not everything is suitable for A/B testing, and there is a fine art to planning tests properly.</p>

<h4>Start with a strong hypothesis</h4>

<p>Don&rsquo;t use a scattergun approach, this should be something you are confident about that is backed by data.</p>

<h4>Ensure that the hypothesis is testable.</h4>

<p>A good A/B testing candidate should be noticeable change, with decent traffic and an expectation for a double-digit improvement to a metric close to the area you are affecting (i.e. don&rsquo;t expect a change on your category page will have a measurable effect on overall conversion through your checkout).</p>

<p>We usually calculate the test plan using something like <a href="http://www.experimentcalculator.com/">experimentcalculator.com</a></p>

<h4>Agree the success metric upfront.</h4>

<p>Don&rsquo;t leave it open to interpretation, don&rsquo;t let ego get in the way, and <em>be willing to lose</em>. The truth can be humbling.</p>

<h4>Use more than one source of data.</h4>

<p>We use Optimizely to run the tests, but do most of our analysis through Google Analytics and KISSmetrics custom segments. This allows us to understand how users of each variation are behaving throughout their whole journey.</p>

<h3>Go with your gut</h3>

<p>We don&rsquo;t make <em>every</em> decision using data. Sometimes it just isn&rsquo;t possible, particularly with creative decisions, and in other times there isn&rsquo;t a lot that can be learned by analysis.</p>

<p>There is never absolute truth in numbers, and it&rsquo;s best to just <a href="http://www.gv.com/lib/design-instinct-vs-data">go with your instincts</a> and have the confidence to push forward.</p>

    <p>We&rsquo;re big fans of <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html">TDD</a> here at Easyart. So far this has only applied to our Ruby code, but with JavaScript increasingly becoming a bigger part of our technology stack, we needed to start testing that too.</p>

<h3>Choosing the right tool</h3>

<p>We chose <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html">Jasmine</a> as our testing framework, partly because of its similarity to RSPEC, and also because its really easy to get started with.</p>

<p>You can get started with Jasmine fairly quickly. Their <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/tree/master/dist">standalone distribution</a> has everything you need to get up and running. Opening the included <code>SpecRunner.html</code> will run the example tests and show you the results. From here you can swap out the example files with your own.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/jasmine-specrunner.png" alt="the Jasmine specrunner" /></p>

<h3>Getting up and running on Rails</h3>

<p>Once we settled on Jasmine, we needed a way to integrate it into our current workflow, as we don&rsquo;t want to be running tests manually all the time.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is an official <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-gem">Jasmine gem</a>. To add this to your project add the following to your gemfile:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="ss">group</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">development</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:test</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">&quot;jasmine&quot;</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>


<p>To setup the file structure that the gem expects for your tests, run the following command from your CLI, which will set up all the necessary files and directory structure to begin testing your code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">rails</span> <span class="n">g</span> <span class="ss">jasmine</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">install</span></code></pre></div>


<h3>Running the tests</h3>

<p>There are two ways you can run your Jasmine tests. The first is to run the following rake task:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">rake</span> <span class="n">jasmine</span></code></pre></div>


<p>This will fire up a web server, accessible at <code>localhost:8888</code> where you will see an HTML document displaying the results of your tests.</p>

<p>You can also run the tests in continuous integration mode from the command line, which will show you the results in the terminal:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">rake</span> <span class="ss">jasmine</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">ci</span></code></pre></div>


<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/jasmine-cli-specrunner.png" alt="the Jasmine CLI specrunner" /></p>

<h3>Writing the tests</h3>

<p>As I mentioned before, Jasmine is easy to get started with, as long as you are reasonably comfortable with JavaScript, but if like me, you&rsquo;re new to writing tests it can be hard to figure out where to start.</p>

<p>The key is to write code that is actually testable. The simplest way to do that is to ensure your code returns something. I attended a testing workshop a little over a year ago with <a href="http://rmurphey.com">Rebecca Murphey</a>, and she described this as:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Things don&rsquo;t do things - things announce things&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>She also advised to have the following question in mind when writing tests:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Given this input, do I get this output?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>For more on testable JavaScript, I recommend starting with <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/writing-testable-javascript">Rebecca&rsquo;s A List Apart article</a>.</p>

<h3>Going forwards</h3>

<p>So far we don&rsquo;t have as much JavaScript code coverage as we would like, but  with a little discipline we&rsquo;ll eventually get to a place where we can be confident that our code is always working.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling to solve a problem for some time now. The agile (with a lower-case &ldquo;a&rdquo;) <a href="/2013/04/16/easyart-flavoured-agile/">approach</a> we use for software development and the long-term roadmaps we have as a business have always been too disconnected, but I never quite knew how to connect them.</p>

<p>Recently, inspired by a deeper understanding of the <a href="/2014/02/16/lean-ux-at-easyart/">lean approaches</a>, I think I&rsquo;ve finally connected them together in these five steps. It&rsquo;s still an emerging process, but I&rsquo;m hopeful it will solve a number of problems.</p>

<h3>Keep an inventory of hypotheses</h3>

<p>We all have ideas for ways to improve the site. Some of them are bound to make a positive difference, others will make the site worse, and most will have no measurable effect at all.</p>

<p>We keep a spreadsheet of these ideas, documented as hypotheses (if I do x, y will happen), along with as much additional information as we have. This ideas backlog becomes our ammunition to improve the site. Importantly, these are not added to Basecamp, where the tasks live until they have been prioritised.</p>

<h3>Establish themes</h3>

<p>In order to prioritise the ideas backlog, I work with other managers to decide on a theme for each month. To establish the theme we might look at under-performing parts of the conversion funnel, goals in other parts of the business, tech roadmap etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes the theme might be very specific (increase percentage of framed products sold), or more generic (increase AOV or improve funnel conversion for search, product, cart, order complete).</p>

<p>Rallying the team around a focussed goal helps us dive deeper into interconnected ideas. We spend 60% of our development time working on tasks related to the theme, while the other 40% is reserved for fixing bugs, cost of doing business tasks, documentation, research etc.</p>

<h3>Prioritise hypotheses around themes</h3>

<p>Once the theme is established, we hold a workshop to prioritise the hypotheses from the backlog in the ways most likely to improve the target KPI.</p>

<p>These competing ideas will vary wildly in difficulty and will probably contradict each another. Using experiment mapping and PIE ranking we can prioritise these based on value.</p>

<h3>Create tasks from prioritised hypotheses</h3>

<p>Once priorities are established, tasks are added to the &ldquo;Next up&rdquo; or &ldquo;Backlog&rdquo; lists in Basecamp, along with the corresponding hypothesis. Depending on our level of confidence in the task, we may use a combination of data analysis, user testing and competitor analysis to research the best solution.</p>

<p>Tasks move through a Kanban-esque process through &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; and &ldquo;QA&rdquo; through its lifecycle, collecting more and more information as it goes.</p>

<h3>Validate hypothesis</h3>

<p>Once in &ldquo;QA&rdquo;, a combination of user testing and split testing will be used to validate or invalidate our hypothesis.</p>

<p>Minor variations will take a long time to reach statistical confidence, so we only split test meaningful changes. We always agree on the measure of success upfront, but also cross-check side-effects with Analytics segments.</p>

<p>Once a conclusion is reached, the task is marked as complete, links to the task/discussion/tests added to the spreadsheet before it&rsquo;s moved to a &ldquo;completed tests&rdquo; sheet, and annotations added to Analytics for before-and-after analysis.</p>

<p>With each test, we increase our shared understanding of what our customers want, which in turn generates high quality ideas for future testing.</p>

    <p>This is part 2 of a post which tries to explain a method of enhancing an auto-complete search box to act in a similar way to the Google search box.
<a href="/2013/11/12/a-somewhat-better-autocomplete/">&raquo; Read part one here &laquo;</a></p>

<h2>A solution</h2>

<p>Something that would work perfectly for this style of query would be to use a regular expression query with a <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html">lookahead assertion</a>.</p>

<p>But wait, <em>MySQL doesn&rsquo;t support look(ahead|behind) assertions!</em>, I hear you say. That&rsquo;s ok, we&rsquo;ll do it the hard way, in code.</p>

<h2>The query</h2>

<p>First we need to mangle the input into a query that will get us most of the way using plain old sql. For example, if the user enters the string <strong>pcr</strong> (perhaps looking for the <strong>p</strong>rint <strong>c</strong>ategory <strong>r</strong>eport), we want to end up with the following:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="k">select</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">admin_pages</span> <span class="k">where</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">page_description</span> <span class="k">like</span> <span class="s1">&#39;%p%&#39;</span> <span class="k">and</span> 
    <span class="n">page_description</span> <span class="k">like</span> <span class="s1">&#39;%c%&#39;</span> <span class="k">and</span> 
    <span class="n">page_description</span> <span class="k">like</span> <span class="s1">&#39;%r%&#39;</span> <span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div>


<p>This will return all pages that have <strong>every</strong> one of those letters in the description in alphabetical order.</p>

<ul>
<li>/admin/<strong>p</strong>rint_<strong>c</strong>atego<strong>r</strong>ies.php</li>
<li>/admin/<strong>p</strong>rodu<strong>c</strong>t_sales_<strong>r</strong>eport.php</li>
<li>/admin/su<strong>p</strong>plier_sto<strong>c</strong>ked_item_<strong>r</strong>eport.php</li>
</ul>


<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem. The ordering of letters matters. We only want pages that contain a <strong>p</strong> followed by 0 or more letters, then a <strong>c</strong> followed by 0 or more letters, followed by an <strong>r</strong>. No matter, this will at least give us something to start with. It&rsquo;s better than stuffing the entire database table into memory for searching.</p>

<p>The code that constructs this query is below (I&rsquo;ve removed any security/sanitisation code to avoid cluttering up the example.):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">page_desc_sql</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$s</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;page_description like &#39;%</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="nv">$s</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">%&#39;&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// a-z only please...</span>
<span class="nv">$query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">preg_replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/[^a-z]/&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">strtolower</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_GET</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;q&quot;</span><span class="p">]));</span>

<span class="c1">// build query</span>
<span class="nv">$s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">implode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot; and &quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">array_map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;page_desc_sql&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">str_split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$query</span><span class="p">)));</span>

<span class="nv">$sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="s2">    select</span>
<span class="s2">        page_id,</span>
<span class="s2">        page_name,</span>
<span class="s2">        page_description</span>
<span class="s2">    from</span>
<span class="s2">        admin_pages</span>
<span class="s2">    where</span>
<span class="s2">        (</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="nv">$s</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">)</span>
<span class="s2">    order by page_description asc</span>
<span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span></code></pre></div>


<p>So now we have a list of pages ready to process. Let&rsquo;s create that lookahead expression.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">page_regex</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;(?=</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="nv">$x</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">).*&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nv">$regex</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nb">implode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">array_map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;page_regex&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">str_split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$query</span><span class="p">)))</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/i&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span></code></pre></div>


<p>This sets $regex to the string:<br/>
<strong>/(?=p).*(?=c).*(?=r).*/i</strong></p>

<p>The final piece of the puzzle is to take the results and pass them through this regex, only returning the ones that match. Then output some json for the auto-complete to use.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$q</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">next_record</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>
