    <p>I&rsquo;ve just got back from the <a href="http://2012.full-frontal.org/#tooling">Full Frontal Tooling Workshops</a> in Brighton, so I thought I&rsquo;d best write about my experience whilst it&rsquo;s still fresh in my mind.</p>

<h3>The set up</h3>

<p>There were six different workshops in total, with <a href="http://remysharp.com">Remy Sharp</a>, <a href="http://rmurphey.com">Rebecca Murphey</a> and <a href="http://jakearchibald.co.uk/">Jake Archibald</a> each leading two sessions. They were structured so participants could attend <em>any</em> four of the workshops throughout the day. The topics were:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Modularizing your JavaScript with RequireJS</strong> &mdash; Rebecca Murphey</li>
<li><strong>Writing Testable JavaScript</strong> &mdash; Rebecca Murphey</li>
<li><strong>Massive git</strong> &mdash; Jake Archibald</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s your Sass on the line</strong> &mdash; Jake Archibald</li>
<li><strong>Debugging</strong> &mdash; Remy Sharp</li>
<li><strong>Build Process</strong> &mdash; Remy Sharp</li>
</ul>


<h3>What to choose?</h3>

<p>I chose the require.js, testable JavaScript, debugging and build process workshops. I didn&rsquo;t opt for the git workshop as I use it daily and am relatively comfortable with it and the same goes for Sass (although we currently use LESS at Easyart). Whilst I&rsquo;m sure they were great workshops, I felt I would benefit a lot more from the others, especially as they addressed topics that I have become very interested in lately.</p>

<h3>Modularizing your JavaScript with RequireJS</h3>

<p>We started with an existing project, which had several script tags linking to various JavaScript files such as jQuery, Backbone, Underscore and more. Rebecca then showed us how to use <a href="http://requirejs.org/">require.js</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD">AMD format</a> to manage our dependencies and modules, and then going on to build the project with a simple command.</p>

<p>This got me thinking about the way our JavaScript is structured, and whilst it has certainly seen improvement over the past six months or so, it could be taken a stage further by introducing require.js into our process.</p>

<h3>Writing Testable JavaScript</h3>

<p>We have been focusing on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-driven development</a> quite a lot lately and have also identified that we need to be doing unit tests on our JavaScript so this topic was particularly relevant to me.</p>

<p>Rebecca introduced us to <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit">QUnit</a> and explained the thought-process behind unit testing and writing testable JavaScript.</p>

<p>When carrying out unit tests, we are essentially asking the following question:</p>

<blockquote><p>Given this input, do I get this output?</p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Rebecca Murphey</p>

<p>This sounds simple, and really it is. The main thing to get your head around is writing JavaScript that is actually testable. Rebecca showed us some <em>typical</em> jQuery code, which was distinctly lacking in functions or output, and explained how it was very difficult to test, and went on to explain how to write JavaScript that actually returns something so we can test it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Things don&rsquo;t do things &mdash; Things announce things</p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Rebecca Murphey</p>

<p>The process of writing good tests should be to make them fail first, and then write the necessary code to make them pass. Well written tests not only ensure that your code is actually working, they help you to write better code.</p>

<p>One point that stood out to me in this workshop was not to get too hung up on testing edge cases. Make your tests as thorough as they need to be and then if an edge case does occur, write the test, then fix the problem.</p>

<p>Later, we were briefly introduced to <a href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/">Mocha</a>, a more advanced testing framework, and also shown how to integrate testing with <a href="http://gruntjs.com">grunt.js</a>.</p>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p>Being a developer, I&rsquo;m no stranger to the Chrome developer tools but I&rsquo;ve never really used them to their full potential.</p>

<p>During this workshop, Remy introduced us to the concept of step debugging and setting breakpoints. I had come across breakpoints before but wasn&rsquo;t really sure how I could use them to debug code so I found this really helpful.</p>

<p>Something Remy said, which I have heard quite a lot, is that if you are using alerts for debugging you should stop right now. <code>console.log</code> is your friend.</p>

<p>After a run through of the various tabs in the Chrome developer tools, Remy talked to us about mobile debugging.</p>

<p>Debugging code in mobile browsers can be a nightmare, but Remy showed us something called <a href="http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/">weinre</a>, which basically listens to your ip address and binds itself to it, allowing you to open the developer tools on your machine and debug in your mobile browser.</p>

<p>One thing that was stressed was the importance of testing on real devices. Emulators are fine for getting a quick overview but if you are doing any mobile specific work, get real phones.</p>

<h3>Build Process</h3>

<p>This workshop was based around a tool called <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a>, which is, in its own words, a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.</p>

<p>Grunt is very powerful and can take care of a lot of otherwise mundane tasks for you such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Concatenating files</li>
<li>Generating project scaffolding</li>
<li>Linting your code</li>
<li>Minifying your code</li>
<li>Running unit tests</li>
<li>Starting a static web server</li>
</ul>


<p>These are just the built-in tasks. Grunt is still very new but despite this, there are already over 200 plugins available.</p>

<p>This got me thinking about our build process and how it could be streamlined using this tool. We currently compile, concatenate and minify our Less files using <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a>, the same goes for our JavaScript which we also run through JSHint. This works for us, but can sometimes feel cumbersome.</p>

<p>The possibilities with Grunt are endless and I also feel like it would give us more control over our projects so it is definitely something I will investigate adding to our process.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I really felt like I got a lot out of these workshops today. It was a lot of information to take in but the key points all came across. I really liked the format and 90 minutes seems to be about the perfect length for workshop sessions of this kind.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Remy is planning to do something similar next year but if he does I hope I will be lucky enough to attend once more.</p>

    <p>When developing a customer facing site, such as Easyart.com, is it very important to be aware of your users perspective. The recommended way to do this is something known as user testing.</p>

<h3>What is user testing</h3>

<p>User testing is essentially watching how people use your website/application. Traditionally, this is done by arranging a session for people to come and use your site, where they would be given tasks to complete. The process is recorded and then analysed to see what could be improved.</p>

<p>Mostly due to time and budget constraints, this isn&rsquo;t always easy to accomplish, but luckily there is now a whole host of affordable services that help us solve this problem.</p>

<h3>Choosing a service</h3>

<p>When choosing a service for any reason, the important thing is to establish exactly what you need from it. We did some research on user testing and decided that we would need a video of the session along with the audio, and the ability to ask follow-up questions. The service that seemed to be the best fit for us was <a href="http://usertesting.com">usertesting.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Setting up the test</h3>

<p>To kick off the test, we needed a set of tasks. We called this a user journey, and set a list of tasks for the participants of the test to follow, demonstrating the areas we knew we needed to work on.</p>

<h3>Getting the feedback</h3>

<p>Within the hour, all three of the tests we set-up had been completed and we had access to the videos. Over the next couple of days we watched these videos, listened to the commentaries and read the answers to our follow-up questions, taking notes the whole time.</p>

<p>Almost immediately we identified some key areas that we needed to work on and have already started working on solutions to improve our customers experience on our site.</p>

<h3>Going forward</h3>

<p>From now on, we plan to run user tests regularly, as we have found it provides a valuable insight into how our site is used and how it can be improved.</p>

<p>User testing <em>will</em> make your site better and <a href="http://usertesting.com">usertesting.com</a> is a great tool for helping you achieve this.</p>

    <p>This week thousands fellow web makers, CEOs, VCs and geeks descended on Dublin for the Dublin Web Summit. They had done an amazing job of promoting the event - there were flags on the mains streets, front-page coverage in papers and loads of media reporting live from the event (to the point where the wifi was almost useless!). The event itself had four stages, an expo room with startups from all over the world, and startup pitching stages. The overall highlight had to be DWS By Night, where they had taken over a whole street of pubs and clubs with free drinks for attendees. There were bound to be some sore heads on Thursday morning!</p>

<h3>Startup pitching stages</h3>

<p>Though the calibre of speakers on the stages was second to none (in Europe at least), I spent a lot of time on the startup pitching stages seeing what was happening in the startup world. Some highlights from the pitching stages and stands:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.copygr.am/">Copygr.am</a>. Tools for Instagram, and photographic prints. The design is lovely, but the prints are too expensive.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fabsie.com/">Fabsie</a>. Designer flatpack furniture manufactured on demand from crowdsourced manufacturers. I was really impressed by this but wonder how far they can go with the aesthetic they are locked into with laser cut wood.</li>
<li><a href="http://resumup.com/">Resump</a>. &ldquo;ResumUp is a service which shows you who and what you need to know to achieve all your career goals.&rdquo; It helps you visualise your skills and connects you with people who are already in your network to progress your career.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.atooma.com/">Atoomba</a>. Basically IFTT for your (Android) mobile.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.smartthings.com/">Smart Things</a>. These guys won the pitching competition for their impressive system to connect devices to the internet. This (or something like it) is going to be a big deal.</li>
<li><a href="https://tictail.com/">Tictail</a>. Quick and easy online stores with a killer UI. I tried it out and had as store online in 2minutes, and actually enjoyed the process. The resulting stores are just OK but the creation process is really impressive.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Chris Poole 4chan, Founder</h3>

<p>The subheading of this talk was something like <em>how I unwittingly became a sysadmin</em>, and was a story of how 4chan serves 600m page views a month and 1m new posts a day on five second-hand servers - each of which is a single point of failure - and no full-time staff.</p>

<p>By looking at the numbers that Google Analytics (which fires in the client via JavaScript) and Cloudflare (which was the entry point to the web request) were reporting, he realised that that half of their traffic was coming from web scrapers and third-party extensions, so it was only then that they added an API (which now serves 50m requests a day).</p>

<p>This was a really interesting talk with some refreshingly honest views, but it does go against a lot of things I believe as a software engineer, and I very much doubt that he has taken the same approach with his VC-funded startup <a href="http://canv.as/">Canv.as</a></p>

<h3>Curating the e-commerce revolution</h3>

<p>A panel discussion with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chris Morton, Ceo &amp; Co-Founder of Lyst</li>
<li>Diego Berdakin, President of BeachMint</li>
<li>Shauna Mei, Founder AHAlife.com</li>
<li>Carl Fritjofsson, Co-Founder &amp; COO Wrapp</li>
<li>Olivia Gossett, founder of ILWYW.com</li>
</ul>


<p>The basic theme of the discussion was that in online fashion retail, customers expect recommendations and a back-story (and increasingly customisation) in order to connect with the product. There seemed to be general agreement that the Net a Porter &ldquo;shop the story&rdquo; approach is a model that works well.</p>

<p>Amazon&rsquo;s approach is to fulfil commands (you search for TVs, you get TVs), but is terrible for serendipitous discovery. &ldquo;You never go to a grocery store and bring back only what was on your list&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Serendipity through content. Create desire through stories and context.</p>

<p><a href="http://new.livestream.com/websummit/DWS12Main/videos/4985557">Here&rsquo;s a recording</a> of the panel (watch from 1:47:40)</p>

<h3>More highlights in brief</h3>

<ul>
<li>The BBC&rsquo;s Chief Architect, News and Knowledge Gary O'Connor on BBC&rsquo;s dipping their toe in the water of cloud computing. An interesting perspective on the challenges in selling it into ops (they had no choice really, because they had to scale to accommodate London 2012 coverage), selecting a provider (AWS).</li>
<li>Mike McCue, Founder and CEO of Flipboard with MG Siegler, TechCrunch. I didn&rsquo;t really consider Flipboard to be important to publishing, but I have changed my mind now.</li>
<li>Mozilla Chairman Mitchell Baker provided some interesting insights into the state of the web at the moment and Mozilla&rsquo;s mission to keep it open.</li>
<li>Patrick Collison from Stripe was really interesting talk about how they got started, their challenges and growth.</li>
</ul>


<p>Most of the event should be available on this <a href="http://new.livestream.com/websummit">Livestream page</a>.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m just back from <a href="http://webperfdays.org/">WebPerfDays</a> at Facebook&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/facebooklondon">London engineering offices</a> in Covent Garden. It was a really great day out, with some great presenters.</p>

<p>A few notes&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.webperformancetoday.com/">Joshua Bixby</a> is a really good presenter and I&rsquo;ll be following his blog.</li>
<li>Not all performace stats apply to all companies. There were several examples cited of how reducing page load time had either no discernable effect, or even a negative impact (though they were very specific cases).</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mortal companies&rdquo; have different problems to the Googles, Facebooks and Amazons of the world.</li>
<li>Using a CDN doesn&rsquo;t guarantee those assets are delivered to the user faster. Our measurements would suggest otherwise, but a second look at the data would be wise.</li>
<li>97% of mobile response time is on the front end!</li>
<li>I like the concept of a &ldquo;poverty line&rdquo; in performance. i.e. if a metric is below a certain threshold it&rsquo;s &ldquo;poor&rdquo;.</li>
<li>A significant percentage of mobile users prefer the full site rather than a mobile version.</li>
<li>Simply cleaning up code and doing all the things you already know you should be doing will get you 80% of the way to where you need to get to with front-end code.</li>
<li>We should check out <a href="http://www.writegoodcode.com/">writegoodcode.com</a>.</li>
<li>After you optimise your front-end code, you have to be be vigilant about maitaining the gains you have made.</li>
<li>Other people probably have more difficult performance problems to solve than us. Seatwave have to cope for massive (60x) request peaks in requests in a matter of seconds (i.e. when their TVC is aired in the middle of X-Factor or a new concert goes on sale).</li>
<li>We should take a close look on the performance of our third party dependencies. They are generally recognised as evil when it comes to web performance.</li>
<li>Lonely Planet have a really great DevOps culture in their company (see their (dev blog)[http://devops.lonelyplanet.com/]) where metrics are king and web performance is recognised as a priority throughout the whole organisation. * They have gone some way to replacing “HiPPO” (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion) with real data.</li>
<li>Webpagetest.org is a tool that a lot of web performance experts seem to refer to.</li>
<li>Facebook have problems that are extremely unique, and fascinating from an observer&rsquo;s standpoint, but intimidatingly complex from a developer&rsquo;s. Sławek Biel did a really interesting presentation about how Facebook optimises its data access.</li>
<li>Overall, it&rsquo;s just reminded me that we need to continue to focus on performance as part of what we do.</li>
</ul>


<p>Update: Some of the presentations are <a href="http://www.seriticonsulting.com/blog/2012/10/8/webperfdays-summary-and-slides.html">now available online</a>.</p>
