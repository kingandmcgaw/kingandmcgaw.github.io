      <p class="updated">Posted on 26 March 2012 by Steve Rydz</p>
    </header>
    <p>I recently <a href="/2012/03/23/getting-to-know-codekit/">wrote about CodeKit</a> and how it has improved our workflow when using pre-processors, but at the time I didn’t allude to the reason that we would use such things. Whilst LESS and SASS are certainly gaining traction, there are many developers out there who just don’t see the point in using something like that.</p>

<p>I must admit, I too was sceptical when I started reading about this new-fangled way to write CSS. I was confident that my code was of a high standard, efficient and maintainable, and I also loved the hand-crafted feeling you get from hand-coding everything (including vendor pre-fixes). The thing is, I just could see how pre-processors could make my code any better.</p>

<p>Of course I was missing the point. In order to really get the most out of these tools, you need to be writing good quality code anyway. LESS will not make you a better developer, but it can make you more efficient.</p>

<p>The first thing that normally wins people over is the use of variables. How many times have you scrolled up and down that stylesheet, looking for that colour value? Well, not with LESS. Here’s another one. You want your box-shadows to be consistent, and you can’t remember the exact code you used. Again, you could spend a few minutes searching through your stylesheet, or you could just use LESS.</p>

<p>The point is, LESS is great for enabling you to work faster and it can really eliminate the tedious parts of the job too. Really, there is no reason to repeat ourselves in code, time after time. Why not use a tool that takes care of the repetitive tasks for you.</p>

<p>Now, what I have just talked about only scratches the surface of what LESS is capable of, and there is much of it that you might not find useful, and that»s fine. Take what you need from it, but don’t write it off until you have taken the time to see how it can really benefit your workflow.</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 23 March 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p>There has been some debate internally about how naming our systems and applications. On the surface it may seem trivial, I find having a naming scheme really helps for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussing how systems relate to one another. It&rsquo;s much easier to talk about Bootstrap than &ldquo;The Twitter CSS Framework&rdquo;. Significant advances in the application may result in new names, meaning less talk of &ldquo;the new system&rdquo; and &ldquo;the old system&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Organising Git repositories. Calling things &ldquo;API&rdquo; or &ldquo;CSS framework&rdquo; is boring and not specific enough to be useful.</li>
<li>Every project deserves a little personality of its own.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/naming-schemes.jpeg" alt="Naming schemes"></p>

<p>So, with that in mind, we have decided to use movie directors as the naming scheme for our systems, starting with our new API-driven platform, Kubrick. So if &ldquo;<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html">there are only two hard things in Computer Science</a>: cache invalidation and naming things&rdquo;, perhaps we have reason to celebrate!</p>

    <p>CSS pre-processors are all the rage these days, or so it would seem, but it can be a little complicated to get up and running with them, unless you’re using the right tools. Enter <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a>. This little app does pretty much everything from compiling LESS, SASS, HAML and CoffeeScript to optimising images and allowing you to import JavaScript files into each other.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/codekit.jpeg" alt="Codekit"></p>

<p>Since I started using <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> about six months ago I have been on the hunt for an app that can make the process of using it simple. That’s where CodeKit comes into it. Previously I had been using the <a href="http://incident57.com/less/">LESS app</a> and on a surface level found it worked well, but it was lacking a sense of intuitiveness. CodeKit just <em>knows</em> what I’m trying to do and doesn&rsquo;t require much in the way of configuration, at least where LESS is concerned.</p>

<p>I will be writing more about how we use CodeKit at Easyart in the future, but for now I will simply say that if you are at all involved in front-end development then you should check out it out as you will surely find it will improve your workflow and potentially make you more productive.</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 22 March 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p>For a number of years I&rsquo;ve really loved using <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> for team chat and collaboration, but today I&rsquo;ve cancelled our account. I&rsquo;ve found that as time has gone on, and our team has grown, it&rsquo;s become increasingly frustrating to use. My main issues are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The timeline ends up with too much noise from Github commits and issues.</li>
<li>Search is clunky. You can only search using keywords, and you have to leave the room to do so.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.flowdock.com/">Flowdock</a> solves these problems by using one pane for chat, and another for &ldquo;Team Inbox&rdquo; and Search.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/flowdock.png" alt="Flowdock"></p>

<p>Team Inbox is by far the most useful feature. We use it for:</p>

<ul>
<li>All Github activity. When new files are committed, you can mouse over for a full list of changes, and click to get to the Github commit page. When issues are opened or closed, they show too.</li>
<li>Inbox. We feed in the <a href="http://twitter.com/easyartuk">@easyartuk</a> Twitter account (you can see one of the tweets in the bottom-right corner), and all emails to our developer account, and they&rsquo;ll show up in our feed.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can also comment on any of this activity contextually. So, for instance, I could comment on an email. Search is also really cool too, and you can filter by files, links, and attachments. <em>Without</em> leaving the chat.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a really useful tool for us, and I can&rsquo;t see us going back to Campfire.</p>
