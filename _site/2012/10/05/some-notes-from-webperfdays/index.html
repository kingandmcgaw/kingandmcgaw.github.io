            <h2>Some notes from WebPerfDays</h2>
            <p class="updated">Posted on 05 October 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
          </header>
          <p>I&rsquo;m just back from <a href="http://webperfdays.org/">WebPerfDays</a> at Facebook&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/facebooklondon">London engineering offices</a> in Covent Garden. It was a really great day out, with some great presenters.</p>

<p>A few notes&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.webperformancetoday.com/">Joshua Bixby</a> is a really good presenter and I&rsquo;ll be following his blog.</li>
<li>Not all performace stats apply to all companies. There were several examples cited of how reducing page load time had either no discernable effect, or even a negative impact (though they were very specific cases).</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mortal companies&rdquo; have different problems to the Googles, Facebooks and Amazons of the world.</li>
<li>Using a CDN doesn&rsquo;t guarantee those assets are delivered to the user faster. Our measurements would suggest otherwise, but a second look at the data would be wise.</li>
<li>97% of mobile response time is on the front end!</li>
<li>I like the concept of a &ldquo;poverty line&rdquo; in performance. i.e. if a metric is below a certain threshold it&rsquo;s &ldquo;poor&rdquo;.</li>
<li>A significant percentage of mobile users prefer the full site rather than a mobile version.</li>
<li>Simply cleaning up code and doing all the things you already know you should be doing will get you 80% of the way to where you need to get to with front-end code.</li>
<li>We should check out <a href="http://www.writegoodcode.com/">writegoodcode.com</a>.</li>
<li>After you optimise your front-end code, you have to be be vigilant about maitaining the gains you have made.</li>
<li>Other people probably have more difficult performance problems to solve than us. Seatwave have to cope for massive (60x) request peaks in requests in a matter of seconds (i.e. when their TVC is aired in the middle of X-Factor or a new concert goes on sale).</li>
<li>We should take a close look on the performance of our third party dependencies. They are generally recognised as evil when it comes to web performance.</li>
<li>Lonely Planet have a really great DevOps culture in their company (see their (dev blog)[http://devops.lonelyplanet.com/]) where metrics are king and web performance is recognised as a priority throughout the whole organisation. * They have gone some way to replacing “HiPPO” (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion) with real data.</li>
<li>Webpagetest.org is a tool that a lot of web performance experts seem to refer to.</li>
<li>Facebook have problems that are extremely unique, and fascinating from an observer&rsquo;s standpoint, but intimidatingly complex from a developer&rsquo;s. Sławek Biel did a really interesting presentation about how Facebook optimises its data access.</li>
<li>Overall, it&rsquo;s just reminded me that we need to continue to focus on performance as part of what we do.</li>
</ul>


<p>Update: Some of the presentations are <a href="http://www.seriticonsulting.com/blog/2012/10/8/webperfdays-summary-and-slides.html">now available online</a>.</p>
