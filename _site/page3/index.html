    <p>In our never-ending mission to make our codebase more maintainable, we decided to package up our shared CSS into a gem so we can use it on all of our projects easily, without having to worry about things going out of sync.</p>

<p>This seemed daunting to me, as I&rsquo;d never done anything like this before, but after some reading and googling, I found it wasn&rsquo;t actually that complicated. Here&rsquo;s how I did it:</p>

<h2>What you&rsquo;ll need</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ensure rubygems is up to date by running <code>gem update --system</code> from your terminal</li>
<li>Install <strong>bundler</strong> by running <code>gem install bundler</code></li>
<li>A <a href="http://github.com">github</a> repo for the gem</li>
<li>An account on <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Creating the gem</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I&rsquo;ve called my gem <em>craven</em>, so wherever you see this, you should replace it with the name of your gem.</p>

<p>You can use bundler to create the scaffolding for your gem. All you have to do is run:</p>

<pre><code>    bundle gem craven
</code></pre>

<p>Believe it or not, this is almost good-to-go, but we need to do a small amount of config first.</p>

<p>Open the file <code>craven/lib/craven.rb</code> and edit it so it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    require "craven/version"

    module Craven
        class Engine &lt; Rails::Engine
        end
    end
</code></pre>

<p>Now open the file <code>craven/craven.gemspec</code> and fill out any sections containing <code>TODO:</code>. I also set the homepage to my github repo:</p>

<pre><code>    spec.homepage = "http://github.com/easyart/craven
</code></pre>

<h2>Adding your assets</h2>

<p>Now you can add your assets to the gem. Assuming your assets are intended to be used as a library, you should use the <code>vendor</code> directory structure, so all your stylesheets are included in  <code>craven/vendor/assets/stylesheets/craven/</code>.</p>

<h2>Bumping the version number</h2>

<p>Now you are almost ready to publish your gem, but each time you do, you will need to bump up the version of your gem, otherwise it will fail. You can do this in <code>craven/lib/craven/version.rb</code>.</p>

<h2>Publishing the gem</h2>

<p>Now for the exciting part - you&rsquo;re about to publish your first ruby gem. To do this, just run:</p>

<pre><code>    bundle exec rake release
</code></pre>

<p>This will publish the gem and push your changed to github. The first time you do this you will be prompted to fill out some credentials. From then on, all you will have to do is run the above command to publish changes to your gem.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Known by many names; the auto-complete, typeahead, search suggestion or incremental search box is an invaluable feature of any website. An example of it&rsquo;s use would be to find the latest news about <strong>Lance Armstrong</strong>. If you Google only the partial words &ldquo;<strong>lan</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>arm</strong>&rdquo; Google will be smart enough to fill in the blanks.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/lanarm.png" alt="Lance Armstrong" /></p>

<h2>The project</h2>

<p>The project I&rsquo;m about to explain was done for an internal administration menu here at <a href="http://www.easyart.com">Easyart</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/admin-menu.png" alt="Admin menu" /></p>

<p>Over the years our admin has grown so large that a simple list of pages was simply too long to navigate. Even after grouping
and hiding them under dropdown menus we thought there must be a quicker way of getting to a specific page.</p>

<p>An auto-complete input field would fit the bill.</p>

<h2>A typical auto-complete setup</h2>

<p>A typical setup might use <a href="http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/">Twitter&rsquo;s Typeahead</a> library which does an ajax call to a server which receives the partial search term and returns matching records. The results are displayed in real-time as a list of options and are updated on each keypress.</p>

<h2>But there&rsquo;s a problem</h2>

<p>Firstly, you need to know the exact spelling of the words you are after. Many auto-complete libraries search from the beginning of words. If you miszpel your target term, you are out of luck. Good luck to sports writers wanting to find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhonny_Peralta">Jhonny Peralta&rsquo;s</a> batting average on your <a href="http://www.dominicanbaseballguy.com/">Dominican Major League baseball blog</a>.</p>

<p>Also, if you have many records that start with the same phrase, and your auto-complete only shows the top 10, how do you find the one that you <em>know</em> is there but is hidden at number 15?</p>

<h2>A better way to search</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever used the <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> editor you&rsquo;ll be familiar with the &ldquo;search anywhere&rdquo; paradigm. To find a file, normally you would go to the search box and type <strong>filename.txt</strong>, then hit <strong>search</strong>, then off it would go to hunt down your file. But with &ldquo;search anywhere&rdquo; you can find what you want in a fraction of the time.</p>

<p>For example, to search the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">Rails source code</a> for the file &ldquo;<strong>active_record_callbacks.rb</strong>&rdquo; you could type:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>arb</strong>&rdquo; which matches &ldquo;<strong>a</strong>ctive_<strong>r</strong>ecord_<strong>c</strong>allbacks.rb&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>reccall</strong>&rdquo; which matches &ldquo;active_<strong>rec</strong>ord_<strong>cal</strong>lbacks.rb&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>arec</strong>&rdquo; which matches &ldquo;<strong>a</strong>ctive_<strong>rec</strong>ord_callbacks.rb&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/active-record-callback.png" alt="Searching for Active Record Callback" /></p>

<p>There are only two rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>All letters must be in the name of the item (obviously)</li>
<li>Letters must appear in the correct order</li>
</ul>


<h2>So how do we do this in code?</h2>

<p>The typical auto-complete setup will take the input and (after sanitising of course) ask the database with a &ldquo;like&rdquo; query to find matches.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="k">select</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="k">table_name</span> <span class="k">where</span> <span class="n">description</span> <span class="k">like</span> <span class="ss">&quot;%QUERY%&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></div>


<p>This does an ok job, but it&rsquo;s not perfect. It&rsquo;s just not as flexible or fast as it could be.</p>

<h2>Our solution</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html">Positive zero-length lookahead assertions</a> of course!</p>

<p>Come back for <a href="/2014/02/17/a-somewhat-better-auto-complete-(part-2)/"><strong>Part Two</strong></a> of this post for the code.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve recently moved over to using <a href="www.google.co.uk/tagmanager%E2%80%8E">Google Tag Manager</a> (GTM) on the redesign of <a href="www.worldgallery.co.uk">Worldgallery</a>. The promise of being able to <em>&ldquo;update your website tags&hellip;without bugging the IT folks.&rdquo;</em> was too hard to pass up. The reality of GTM, however, has proven to be something all together different.</p>

<p>We also use <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a> quite heavily on the new site. And the easy integration with Google Analytics(GA) via <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingCustomVariables">Custom Variables</a> mean that we can easily segment the Optimizely visitors by buckets. For instance, we can run a report that gives us &ldquo;Ecommerce value of all visitors who saw Version A of the checkout page&rdquo; or &ldquo;Time on page for visitors who saw Version B of a certain landing page&rdquo;. This greatly enhances the default reporting from Optimizely.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Now that Google Tag Manager is responsible for loading all javascript on the page, we need to be sure that they get executed in the correct order. And that order is 1) Optimizely followed by 2) Google Analytics</p>

<p>By default, GTM does what it does as and when it sees fit. So we can&rsquo;t be sure that the tags will fire as needed. However the fix for this particular problem <a href="http://www.verticalnerve.com/blog/detail?id=278">has already been solved</a>.</p>

<p>In a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
<li>Load the Optimizely code in a GTM <strong><a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2574372#CustomHTML">Custom HTML Tag</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Then set a dataLayer variable in that tag which says &ldquo;OK - Ready to go&rdquo;</li>
<li>That then triggers the GA pageview to fire. Simple!</li>
</ul>


<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t enough to make it work&hellip;</p>

<p>Yes, we could fire the GA pageview at the right time - after Optimizely has done it&rsquo;s thing. But for some reason the Custom Variables still weren&rsquo;t being sent along with the request.</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>Fast forward about 30 hours of head-scratching and a large handful of experiments. When finally the missing piece of the puzzle was found.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2574372#TrackerName">poorly documented</a> feature of GTM for the <strong>Tracker Name</strong> setting. Reading this would lead one to believe that all this setting does is allow you to <em>&ldquo;name the tracker object yourself&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>What isn&rsquo;t mentioned is that by turning on this setting (which can be found under <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> for the <strong>Page View</strong> tag) you effectively make the tracker name public. This is your UA-XXXXXX-X number. Without this information Optimizely is not able to set the Custom Variable correctly.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If you use <strong>Google Tag Manager</strong> along with <strong>Optimizely</strong> and want to take advantage of <strong>Google Analytics</strong> <em>Custom Variable</em> segmentation - pause for breath - then you need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tick the box next <strong>Tracker Name</strong> under <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> (but don&rsquo;t fill anything in the text box!)</li>
<li>Follow <a href="http://www.verticalnerve.com/blog/detail?id=278">these instructions</a> to ensure the correct load order of scripts</li>
<li>GOTO PUB</li>
</ol>

    <p>In reading <a href="https://keen.io/blog/63582764323/what-ctos-fear-most">What CTOs Fear Most</a>, it&rsquo;s clear that managing priorities is a common fear amongst technical managers.</p>

<p>The Easyart technical team is in the midst of redeveloping a platform that has been running for well over a decade, we are continually faced with difficult decisions about what features are worth migrating, and how they compete for resources with new features.</p>

<p>In our circumstance, retaining a feature is actually a new development task which is competing with every other task. Most of the existing features are there for good reason, but it&rsquo;s worth challeging the idea that every old feature is going to have more business value than the new features they are competing with.</p>

<p>Just because we can, it doesn&rsquo;t mean we should. Just because a feature exists, removing it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make the product poorer. This point of view can be unpopular but the opportunity to shed some technical debt and rationalise our offering can make the hard work worthwhile.</p>

<p>Julie Zhuo, Product design director at Facebook makes the point well in her fantastic blog post <a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/f777ec49f24a">The Tax of New</a> (paraphrased here):</p>

<blockquote><p>Run that line of thinking too many times and you get death by a thousand paper cuts. This is how good, simple products become quite the opposite.</p>

<p>The tax that comes with introducing any new feature into your product is high. I cannot stress this enough. Sure, maybe the new feature isn’t hard to build, maybe it only takes a couple days and a handful of people, maybe it can be shipped and delivered by next week.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will continue to develop and evolve it. Even if you don’t (maybe your plan was just to launch it and move on), the fact of its existence will inevitably create more work for you. You will get user requests and bugs about it. You will spend time thinking idly about ways to make it better. It will likely pop up in the context of your next redesign or code rearchitecture.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another great article on the topic by Yammer&rsquo;s CTO, Kris Gale, <a href="http://firstround.com/article/The-one-cost-engineers-and-product-managers-dont-consider">on technical debt and complexity</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>For years, the two things that most frustrated me to hear from product managers were &ldquo;how hard would it be&hellip;&rdquo; and &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you just&hellip;&rdquo; It took me quite a while to figure out why I had such a strong, visceral reaction to these phrases. The answer seems obvious now: The work of implementing a feature initially is often a tiny fraction of the work to support that feature over the lifetime of a product, and yes, we can &ldquo;just&rdquo; code any logic someone dreams up. What might take two weeks right now adds a marginal cost to every engineering project we&rsquo;ll take on in this product in the future. In fact, I&rsquo;d argue that the initial time spent implementing a feature is one of the least interesting data points to consider when weighing the cost and benefit of a feature.</p></blockquote>

<p>And <a href="http://insideintercom.io/there-are-no-small-changes/">this brilliant rant</a> by Des Traynor argues that there is simply no such thing as a small change:</p>

<blockquote><p>Agreeing to features is deceptively easy. Coding them rarely is. Maintaining them can be a nightmare. When you’re striving for quality, there are no small changes.</p></blockquote>

<p>When you release a feature it&rsquo;s not the end of the job, it&rsquo;s just the beginning!</p>

<p>Thankfully none of this means we should avoid new ideas or innovation, we just need to put some process around our decisions to ensure that new features are providing value, not just technical debt.</p>

<p>For existing features, <strong>study the data</strong>. If this feature is providing real business value, it&rsquo;s worth retaining and developing further. If not, consider removing it.</p>

<p>For new features, it&rsquo;s important to <strong>define success criteria upfront</strong>. If the feature doesn&rsquo;t meet the measure of success you&rsquo;ve defined, remove it. And if it does, we know the debt is worth taking on. Ideally these metrics should be published so that later down the line when someone asks &ldquo;why do we have this feature&rdquo;, there is an answer to point to.</p>

<p>Adding these processes requires great discipline, but it provides a confidence that every new feature is providing real value to the company.</p>
