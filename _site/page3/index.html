    <p>I read a thought-provoking comment today on <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/3/26/7-years-of-youtube-scalability-lessons-in-30-minutes.html">High Scalability</a> that got me thinking. It appeared in a post which attempted to sum up &ldquo;<a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/3/26/7-years-of-youtube-scalability-lessons-in-30-minutes.html">7 Years of YouTube Scalability Lessons in 30 Minutes</a>&rdquo;. It shows a neat little trick that you can use to make it appear to the user that your site is faster than it really is. Read on&hellip;</p>

<h3>Approximate Correctness &ndash; Cheat a Little</h3>

<blockquote><p>A real world example. If you write a comment and someone loads the page at the same time, they might not get it for 300-400ms, the user who is reading won’t care. The writer of the comment will care, so you make sure the user who wrote the comment will see it. So you cheat a little bit. Your system doesn’t have to have globally consistent transactions. That would be super expensive and overkill. Not every comment is a financial transaction. So know when you can cheat.</p></blockquote>

<p>So basically you would update the page DOM in real-time, but send the actual comment post operation behind the scenes. It can take as long as it needs to complete. But in the meantime the commenter is happy to have such a quick experience. It&rsquo;s a win-win!</p>

<p>High Scalability is a blog that exposes the architecture of some very well-known and highly trafficked  websites. The posts are often written by the developers of those systems. So if you&rsquo;ve ever wondered how <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/12/19/how-twitter-stores-250-million-tweets-a-day-using-mysql.html">Twitter stores 250,000,000 tweets a day</a> using MySql (no NoSql here), then H.S. is the blog for you.</p>

    <p>It wasn’t that long ago when front-end development was considered to be nothing more than knowing HTML, CSS and jQuery. There wasn’t a great deal more to it, but the role has really developed over the past two years or so.</p>

<p>Yesterday I came across an article that does a great job of outlining what should be required of a front-end developer today. <a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers/">Go read it&hellip;</a></p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 12 April 2012 by Steve Rydz</p>
    </header>
    <p>Something we have been working on recently is finding a unified coding style that we are all comfortable with. The benefits of this are that any one of us can pick up a project and run with it as we are already familiar with the way the project has been set up.</p>

<p>Another aim of ours when authoring code is to be as efficient as possible, not just in terms of file size but in terms of maintainability also.</p>

<p>One tool we have been using to help us acheive this is LESS. Combining LESS with our own coding conventions, each of us can quickly find what we are looking for in our CSS and can also make changes quickly, knowing that what we are doing will be maintainable.</p>

<p>An example would be nesting. LESS allows you to nest selectors like so:</p>

<pre><code>#header {
  overflow: hidden;

  h1 {
    font-size: 3em;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As someone who doesn’t have a background in programming, I did find this initially confusing, but it soon begins to make sense and once you start working this way you will probably never want to go back.</p>

<p>This code will output as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#header {
  overflow: hidden;
}

#header h1 {
  font-size: 3em;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Something else you will notice in the above snippet is that there is a blank line before the descendent selector, an no blank lines after the closing brakets. This is something we agreed upon as a standard because it makes code more readable.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter what your coding conventions are, as long as they make sense to you and your team, but using them will increase productivity considerably and are worth the investment in time it takes to establish them.</p>

<p>Another thing that is worth doing, and again, something we are working on, is drafting a <a href="https://github.com/styleguide/css">CSS styleguide</a>. This is something that you can add to over time as and when you add new tools and methodologies into your process, such as we have, working with LESS and CodeKit.</p>

<p>The key thing to remember is that whatever you come up with, it needs to be something that your team can all get on board with, as the aim is to increase productivity and make things easier to maintain.</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/2012/04/11/history-state-and-the-back-button">History state and the back button</a></h2>
      <p class="updated">Posted on 11 April 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with the HTML5 history API today, in order to make certain parts of our new product page bookmarkable. Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re aiming for:</p>

<ol>
<li>On page1.html, the user clicks an a tag which has a href value of page2.html</li>
<li>Instead of refreshing the page with the contents of framing.html, a panel in the page slides across to reveal the contents of page2.html in the current page</li>
<li>The URL changes to page2.html</li>
</ol>


<p>This is relatively easy to achieve by intercepting these links, and replacing them with Javascript behavior and using the HTML5 History API to push a new URL into the address bar. So, as an example, the following code will find every a on the page and instead of navigating to the href, just push the state into the address bar.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2359314.js"> </script>


<p>So we can quite easily intercept links to page2.html (either based on their href attribute or a CSS class), push the href into the address bar and load the content into the current page in some fancy-pants way.</p>

<p>But say you want the back button to navigate the user from page2.html back to page1.html. This won&rsquo;t work, because unless you tell it to do otherwise, the back button will change the address, but do nothing else.</p>

<p>This is where popstate comes in. Using popstate we can listen for changes in the address, and act upon them accordingly. So my code ended up looking something like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2359401.js"> </script>


<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to pass objects and titles through to pushstate, but I won&rsquo;t go into that for now as it&rsquo;s not yet well supported by browsers. Simply finding out the address of the page was good enough to solve the immediate problem.</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/2012/04/10/testing-rails-json-apis-with-rspec">Testing Rails JSON APIs with RSpec</a></h2>
      <p class="updated">Posted on 10 April 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve spent some time in the last couple of weeks taking the learnings from an early API prototype, and starting a new Rails application from scratch, complete with RSpec tests. Here are some notes on some of our tools and methodologies.</p>

<h3>Model specs</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re overriding the as_json method in our models and we&rsquo;re using <a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/json_spec">json_spec</a> to test the documents have the right structure.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2349770.js"> </script>


<h3>Request specs</h3>

<p>We have hundreds of lines of <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/request-specs/request-spec">request specs</a>, and no controller specs. Here is a simple example:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2349801.js"> </script>


<p>Because we&rsquo;re getting an actual HTTP payload back (in the response variable) we can inspect whatever part of it that&rsquo;s relevant to us. We know the structure of the responses should come back in a known format because we&rsquo;re testing the to_json method in the class specs. So it&rsquo;s just a matter of using JSON.parse on the response.body and testing it as a native Ruby object.</p>

<p>Of course, this means that we are trusting JSON.parse to behave reliably but that&rsquo;s an assumption worth making. If we were really pedantic, we could check that each object in the response array matches the expected structure:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2349803.js"> </script>


<p>Though I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s actually testing anything meaningful.</p>

<p>Another great advantage is that it makes refactoring simple. As far as the specs are concerned, a request to is the same whether the heavy lifting is done in the model or the controller. This really helped me recently when I moved a bunch of logic from the controller to the model as I could let the specs tell me which parts starting misbehaving.</p>
