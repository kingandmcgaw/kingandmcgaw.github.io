<p>We&rsquo;re big fans of <a href="http://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> here at Easyart. It&rsquo;s very close to replacing email for our internal discussions. Here&rsquo;s what we like:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s open.</strong> I might have a discussion with one person, but others can be aware of what&rsquo;s going on by overhearing the discussion in the project or in the daily recap. It&rsquo;s also easy to see who is over subscribed.</li>
<li><strong>Distance is less important.</strong> We have two sites, numerous people that work from home, and a number of contractors. Using Basecamp is our primary means of communication makes collaboration more effective no matter where you are located.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s incredibly simple and fun to use.</strong> It does a small amount of things – to-dos, text documents, discussions, files – really well (we use Google for calendars). I had been meaning to write an internal document on how to use Basecamp but it has never been necessary!</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s totally usable by email only.</strong> Some of our busier people use it purely through email, while others use a combination of online and email.</li>
</ul>


<p>A few things would make it even more useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mentions.</strong> Sometimes the amount of email Basecamp generates is overwhelming, and unless you are assigned to a task you might never know that someone is waiting for a response from you.</li>
<li><strong>A proper CalDAV calendar.</strong> We need to be able to create events from other apps and devices if the calendar is going to be useful for us.</li>
<li><strong>A way to &ldquo;loop in&rdquo; other collaborators into a task or discussion, on the site.</strong> The only way to do this at the moment is to loop them in on email only.</li>
<li><strong>Chat integration.</strong> We <a href="http://easyartdevelopers.posterous.com/goodbye-campfire-hello-flowdock">switched from Campfire to Flowdock</a> back in March, but because most of the action is now in Basecamp, we don&rsquo;t use chat as much. It would be nice to be able to send one-liners in Basecamp without starting new discussions.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Spotted this interesting piece on <a href="http://code.flickr.com/blog/2012/05/15/liquid-photo-page-layout/">Flickr&rsquo;s code blog</a> about the thought behind their new liquid photo page, which is very relevant to some of the things we are thinking about at the moment.</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 02 June 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Colinstrong">Colin Strong</a> from <a href="http://www.gfk.com/">GfK</a> did a great presentation at <a href="http://digitalshoreditch.com/">Digital Shoreditch</a> yesterday on behavioural economics called <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/colinstrong/jam-sandwiches-final">The lesson of jam sandwiches for service developers and marketeers</a> which ties in with a lot of things we&rsquo;ve been discussing internally. Here are my takeaways:</p>

<h3>Avoid choice overload</h3>

<p>In the Jam sandwich study, customers were presented with 24 jams, which resulted in a 3% takeup. When the number of jams was reduced to 6, the takeup jumped to 30%. Reduce choice to increase conversions.</p>

<h3>Decoy options</h3>

<p>Introducing options in a product mix can have an effect on the percieved value of the other options. As an example, when consumers were shown three options for Economist subscriptions&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Online only for $59</li>
<li>Print only for $125</li>
<li>Print and online for $125</li>
</ol>


<p>&hellip;nobody picked option 2 and 84% choose option 3. That&rsquo;s because option 2 is acting as a decoy option 3 more attractive. When option 2 was removed, only 32% selected Option 3.</p>

<h3>Encourage a sense of ownership</h3>

<p>Once consumers feel they own an item they are reluctant to part with it. On Ebay, the highest bidder often starts thinking about possessing item, leading to more aggressive bidding. Amazon Prime’s limited trial makes customers focus on what they will lose if they cancel their subscription.</p>

<h3>Social influence</h3>

<p>Consumers are hugely influenced by the behaviour of others. Stock levels create a fear of missing out. I also think that positive social reinforcement &ndash; showing that other &ldquo;real&rdquo; people are buying an item &ndash; can be a huge influence also.</p>

<h3>Create magic moments</h3>

<p>Overall assessment is not key, only if the customer had a very positive or very negative experience. Create &ldquo;positive peaks&rdquo; through magic moments to leave a positive impression. Add something for free. It&rsquo;s inexpensive and has a disproportionate impact on satisfaction.</p>

      <p class="updated">Posted on 21 May 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>

    <p>Recently we&rsquo;ve switched from FTP to git to deploy changes to our live sites. Here&rsquo;s what our workflow looks like for functional changes (content amends use steps1,2,5,7,8):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/git.jpg" alt="Git-based deploys"></p>

<ol>
<li>Make changes on VMs on develop branch</li>
<li>Commit and push develop branch to Github</li>
<li>Pull develop branch to staging server</li>
<li>Review changes</li>
<li>Merge develop into master</li>
<li>Run Selenium tests</li>
<li>Push master to Github</li>
<li>Pull master into live server</li>
</ol>


<p>By using a Git-centric workflow, it&rsquo;s easier to guarantee that each application is running the same code, and we have the added safety of being able to roll back to previous versions.</p>

<p>Pulling changes onto live websites with millions of daily visitors makes me a little nervous, so I&rsquo;ll usually use <em>git fetch</em> rather than <em>git pull</em>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch
</code></pre>

<p>Pulls the remote master branch into a branch in the local repository called origin/master.</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff --numstat master origin/master
</code></pre>

<p>Reports the affected files between master and the origin/master branch we pulled in the previous step.</p>

<p>  $ git merge master origin/master</p>

<p>Merges the origin/master branch into master.</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/2012/05/01/using-selenium-and-rspec-for-behaviour-testing">Using Selenium and Rspec for behaviour testing</a></h2>
      <p class="updated">Posted on 01 May 2012 by Nick Boyce</p>
    </header>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve been doing some restructuring here at Easyart, in order to set up a more Git-centric workflow for deployments. We wanted to make sure that we had some tests which would help us spot any problems while we made the transition.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m relatively comfortable with Rspec, so it was a natural starting point. But given that the sites themselves aren&rsquo;t built in Ruby, I&rsquo;m using Rspec to power Selenium Webdriver.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample test:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2566740.js"> </script>


<p>The Selenium::WebDriver object makes writing these tests pretty simple. These are the main methods we use:</p>

<ul>
<li>find_element and find_elements</li>
<li>get (or navigate.to, which I think are identical)</li>
<li>title</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it! These are the methods in the Selenium::WebDriver::Element object we are making the most use of:</p>

<ul>
<li>text</li>
<li>click</li>
<li>send_keys</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s an example which makes use of these:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2566849.js"> </script>


<p>One thing that took some getting used to was using the Selenium::WebDriver::Wait object. When you do a click, you have to tell Selenium you want to wait for a certain condition to be true before moving on to the next live of code.</p>

<p>In this example, I&rsquo;m waiting until the H1 tag contains the word &ldquo;cart&rdquo;:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2567891.js"> </script>


<p>I&rsquo;m used Rspec for unit and request specs, but it&rsquo;s advantageous to use a visible browser for this type of testing, as sometimes you can spot things with your eye that your tests won&rsquo;t. Then you write the test to catch it.</p>
