It's been a busy week for the tech team at Easyart this week (more on that later), but I've got a backlog of some interesting links in my Evernote that I want to share.

* [The 90 day plan](http://ryancarson.com/post/41700372023/the-90-day-plan). We try to do quarterly plans here, but this has inspired me to do better.
* [Developer creates Github issues for his house](https://github.com/frabcus/house/issues).
* [Anil Dash: All dashboards should be feeds](http://dashes.com/anil/2013/01/all-dashboards-should-be-feeds.html). I don't entirely agree but he makes an interesting case.
* [Hessian](http://hessian.tv/forsale.html) is a pre-made brand, for sale for $18,000.
* [Multicolr Search Lab](http://labs.tineye.com/multicolr#colors=f68e2b,9fc043,cb4e8d;weights=33,34,33;).
