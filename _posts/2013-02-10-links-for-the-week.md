It's been a busy week for the tech team at Easyart this week (more on that later), but I've got a backlog of some interesting links in my Evernote that I want to share.

* [The 90 day plan](http://ryancarson.com/post/41700372023/the-90-day-plan). We try to do quarterly plans here, but this has inspired me to do better.
* [Developer creates Github issues for his house](https://github.com/frabcus/house/issues).
* [Anil Dash: All dashboards should be feeds](http://dashes.com/anil/2013/01/all-dashboards-should-be-feeds.html). I don't entirely agree but he makes an interesting case.
* [Hessian](http://hessian.tv/forsale.html) is a pre-made brand, for sale for $18,000.
* [Multicolr Search Lab](http://labs.tineye.com/multicolr#colors=f68e2b,9fc043,cb4e8d;weights=33,34,33;).

And this quote from Justin Kan's article [Experienced Hires Will Save You From Yourself](http://www.fastcompany.com/3005469/experienced-hires-will-save-you-yourself):

> My general rule of thumb at Exec has been that as a founder, you should do the first version of everything yourself. Build the first product, test the first sales channels. By doing things yourself, you can quickly discover if they will pay dividends (or if it is time to move on to the next experiment). Once you discover something worth doing, then hire a professional to come in and clean up the mess youâ€™ve made.
