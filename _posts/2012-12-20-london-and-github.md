Interesting review of 2012 from Github in [The Octoverse in 2012](https://github.com/blog/1359-the-octoverse-in-2012):

> Since the beginning of the year, we've seen a doubling in activity, with pushes alone responsible for over 60% of the events in a given day. On a typical weekday, 10k people sign up for a GitHub account, and our users:

> * push 140GB of new data
> * create 25k repositories and 7k pull requests
> * push to 125k repositories
> * Best of all:

> 10k people create their very first repository

Apart from their impressive growth, this little fact caught my eye:

> The top 10 countries visiting GitHub.com are: United States, Germany, United Kingdom, China, Japan, France, India, Canada, Russia and Brazil. The top 10 cities are: London, San Francisco, New York, Paris, Moscow, Beijing, Berlin, Bangalore, Sydney and Toronto.

London is the #1 city for Github users? Go London!
