One of the things I most like about hacker culture is the acceptance (almost celebration) of failure as an essential part of a the path to success.

[This post](http://blog.bahadir.io/posts/failed-entrepreneur.html), and the [accompanying discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4942356) on Hacker News had a few quotes I really liked:

> As soon as you believe you're the smartest man in the room, you're in the wrong room

And this one:

> My job is not programming. My job is delivering value using programming.
