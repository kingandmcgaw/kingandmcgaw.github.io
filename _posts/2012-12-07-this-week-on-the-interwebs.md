I've been enjoying the [Art.sy engineering team's blog](http://artsy.github.com/). Their approach and [technology stack](http://artsy.github.com/blog/2012/10/10/artsy-technology-stack/) are spookily similar to what we have in store for the next generation of the platform at Easyart. Even their blog runs on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) just like this one!

As usual, I've spent a fair bit of time on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/) this week. The question [What is Spotify's architecture?](http://www.quora.com/Spotify/What-is-Spotifys-architecture) had an interesting answer from Spotify developer Niklas Gustavsson. They have around 100 backend services, most of which handle only a single task.

Paul Irish's [Javascript Development Workflow of 2013](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7AU2Ozu8eo) has a lot of good tips. Things are moving so quickly in this space it's hard to keep up, so I find myself watching more and more presentations at home where I would have otherwise been watching TV.

[HTTP Headers For Fun & Profit](http://loopj.com/2012/12/07/http-headers-for-fun-and-profit/) lists some interesting HTTP headers returned by popular sites.

There's a great post called [Why Google Went Offline Today and a Bit about How the Internet Works](http://blog.cloudflare.com/why-google-went-offline-today-and-a-bit-about) over on the CloudFlare blog from a while back that sheds some light on how some of the underlying mechanics of the internetw work.

Finally, [The best interface is no interface](http://www.cooper.com/journal/2012/08/the-best-interface-is-no-interface.html/) is very much an approach we are trying to head towards with some of the product customisation screens we'll launch in 2013. It's really exciting.
