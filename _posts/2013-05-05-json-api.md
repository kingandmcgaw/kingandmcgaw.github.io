I was interested to see [jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org/) spring up on the web recently. Though it's authored by Ember's team, the references to Ember have been moved from the homepage to the [history](http://jsonapi.org/history) section, and it's clear that the ambition is to set a standard for API compatibility between servers and clients.

Overall I applaud the ambition and it's clearly written by clever people. That said, I believe consuming the proposed data structures is more complicated unless you're using a compatible library.

Consider these examples...

> If the value of a resource key is a JSON object, the value represents a single document.
> If the value of a resource key is a JSON array, the value represents a list of documents.

Isn't it better to have the URL scheme define if you are looking at a document or collection? i.e. ``GET /resource`` is a collection and ``GET /resource/document`` is a document?

> To save HTTP requests, it may be convenient to send related documents along with the requested documents.

For example:

    {
      "posts": {
        "id": "1",
        "title": "Rails is Omakase",
        "rels": {
          "author": 9
        }
      },
      "people": [{
        "id": "9",
        "name": "@d2h"
      }]
    }

So to list the post title and author name would be something like:

    {posts.title} by {people.where(id: 9).name}

This is clever and probably the "right" way to do it, but is it easier to consume? I'd suggest that nesting the documents is much easier:

    {
      "posts": {
        "id": "1",
        "title": "Rails is Omakase",
        "author": {
          "id": "9",
          "name": "@d2h"
        }
      }
    }

And it can be consumed like this: 

    {posts.title} by {posts.author.name}
  
Yes, it's imperfect and can result in more duplication and less flexibility, but I think for a lot of cases that isn't an issue.
