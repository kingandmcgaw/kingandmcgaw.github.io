Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman:

> Somewhat surprisingly, few organizations keep track of what’s decided and why.

> This seems idiotic when you consider that often thousands of dollars are spent making a decision. Of the few that do keep track of decisions, fewer will be honest about what’s actually discussed.
    
This one of the reasons I think it's worth spending work hours blogging. To distill ideas and decisions and share them with the organisation and your peers.
