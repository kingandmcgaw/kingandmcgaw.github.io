Lately I've been enjoying a new video series from the [Google Developers channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers?feature=watch) called **The Breakpoint** with [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com) and [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/), which focuses on front-end developer tools.

So far there have been three episodes and I highly recommend checking them out:

* [Episode 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktwJ-EDiZoU)
* [Episode 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXeWjWp-8Y&feature=relmfu)
* [Episode 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=HijZNR6kc9A)
