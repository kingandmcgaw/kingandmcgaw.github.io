Outside of the madness that is Christmas season at Easyart Towers, here are a few nuggets I've enjoyed on the interwebs this week.

1. The animated and excitable [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/)'s talk on [The New And Improved Developer Toolbelt](http://vimeo.com/52450814) from Fronteers 2012 outlines some interesting tools for modern front end development, but I don't see us using Yoeman anytime soon (it's too magic!).
1. I'd seen this one before, and perhaps I am using it as a cheatsheet for his [book](http://www.danpink.com/books/drive) that I haven't quite finished reading yet, but [Dan Pink's TED lecture](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html) on the mismatch between what science knows about motivation and what business does is utterly fascinating.
1. Some useful links in [The Web engineer's online toolbox](http://ivanzuzak.info/2012/11/18/the-web-engineers-online-toolbox.html) that I'll be sure to come back to
1. Another one I re-read is [The evolution of SoundCloud's architecture](http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2012/08/evolution-of-soundclouds-architecture/) as it's relevant to some thinking I am doing at the moment.
1. I'm really excited about what's happening at [GDS](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/). It seems impossibly progressive for a government to assemble a really clever group of designers and (Ruby) developers to build a new integrated web platform, and to make the whole thing open source [and on Github](https://github.com/alphagov)!
1. I could almost see this list of [Useful Talks And Videos From Web Design Conferences](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/09/useful-tech-talks-videos-web-conferences/) replacing TV for me for a while, if only by [Boxee](http://www.boxee.tv/) would switch back on!
