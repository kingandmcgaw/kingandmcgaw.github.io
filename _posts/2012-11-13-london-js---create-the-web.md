Last night I attended [London JS â€” Create the web](http://www.eventhandler.co.uk/events/londonjs-createtheweb), which was hosted at [Forward Technology](http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/).

The first talk was by [Jack Franklin](http://javascriptplayground.com) and was called *Optimising JavaScript*.

It was only a short talk but Jack presented some interesting finds regarding how to do common things with JavaScript quickly. To see some examples of this [go checkout his slides](http://jackfranklin.github.com/ldnjs-optimisation-talk/#/).

The second talk was more of a presentation on some of Adobes new products by [Michael Chaize](https://twitter.com/mchaize) and [Terrance Ryan](https://twitter.com/tpryan).

It really looks like Adobe have stepped up their game and are now developing more web focused tools. They seem to be doing a lot with animation, but from the sound of their laptop fans I'm not sure the world is ready for that yet.

The two tools that impressed me were the yet-to-be-released [Reflow](http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow/) and [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

Reflow is a responsive design application which allows you to set breakpoints and rearrange the design accordingly. Effectively you are editing DOM elements rather than Photoshop layers. I really think a tool like this will help get designers thinking responsively, causing us developers a few less headaches in the process.

Brackets is an open source HTML, CSS and JavaScript editor. It has been designed to be lightweight, front-end focused and extensible. It is built entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and therefore easy to customise and extend with your own plugins. One feature I particularly liked was the ability to select an element from a HTML file and edit the CSS properties for that element without opening another file.

Unfortunately I had to leave before [Sam Duttons](https://twitter.com/sw12/) WebRTC talk so I can't say anything about that.

I did come away with a free [foldable me](https://www.foldable.me/) which I did put together late last night but have yet to photograph.
