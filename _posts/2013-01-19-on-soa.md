I finally got around to reading Paul Dix's [Service-Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Service-Oriented-Design-Rails-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321659368/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358592354&sr=8-1) over the new year break. Having worked on a number of services for a platform at my previous job, I was very familiar with the benefits (and drawbacks) of [service-oriented architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) but it really concreted my understanding of what SOA could do for our organisation.

I've since been devouring articles on the topic, and have listed a few below that I have particularly enjoyed.

* [SOA for the Little Guys](http://rubysource.com/soa-for-the-little-guys/). This article does an amazing job of introducing SOA concepts right through to code examples.
* [Refactor Your Monolithic Rails App to a SOA](http://www.slideshare.net/ChrisWyckoff/refactor-your-monolithic-rails-app-to-a-soa) (particularly slides 11-25)
* [Service Oriented Architecture at Square](http://confreaks.com/videos/1273-rubyconf2012-service-oriented-architecture-at-square). A really interesting presentation from Square's Chris Hunt on their SOA approach. 
* [Abstracting Features Into Custom Reverse Proxies](http://confreaks.com/videos/1270-rubyconf2012-abstracting-features-into-custom-reverse-proxies-or-making-better-lemonade-from-chaos). Another video from Rubyconf on custom proxies to front and normalise multiple services.
* [Amazon Architecture](http://highscalability.com/amazon-architecture). When you view a page on Amazon there are famously more than 100 services that are accessed to build it. This old post on the High Scalability blog outlines Amazon's SOA approach.
* [Scalability Best Practices: Lessons from eBay](http://www.infoq.com/articles/ebay-scalability-best-practices). Detailed article on Ebay's architecture from Randy Shoup.
* [LinkedIn Architecture](http://hurvitz.org/blog/2008/06/linkedin-architecture). Outline of the evolution of LinkedIn from a monolithic app to a service-oriented approach. [Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/linkedin/linkedins-communication-architecture) are also available.
