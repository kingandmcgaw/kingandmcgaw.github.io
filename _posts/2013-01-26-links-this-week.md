Here's some things that popped up on my radar this week:

* [Slideshow with 15 years of the Apple homepage](http://charliehoehn.com/2013/01/14/15-years-of-apple-dot-com-homepage/)
* [LayerVault](https://layervault.com/) have had a lovely redesign.
* [Abe Burmeister: How I Built A Fashion Brand With No Experience, Just Punk Rock Spirit (And The Web)](http://www.organizedwonder.com/videos/1549). Inspiring presentation on the story behind Outlier. 
* [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) looks like a really useful way to get inline help in the terminal for a number of languages
* [Redesigning Google: how Larry Page engineered a beautiful revolution](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution). An in-depth article on Google's new focus on design.
* [Skinny Ties and responsive eCommerce](http://gravitydept.com/blog/skinny-ties-and-responsive-ecommerce/). Case study on a responsive redesign of an ecommerce store.

I've also been making my way through some of the talks from last year's Bacon conference. The three I have watched so far have all been top-notch:

* [Monitoring sucks (and what you can do about it)](http://devslovebacon.com/conferences/bacon-2012/talks/monitoring-sucks-and-what-you-can-do-about-it)
* [Customers who bought music also bought beer](http://devslovebacon.com/conferences/bacon-2012/talks/customers-who-bought-music-also-bought-beer)
* [Stories from a music-fueled distributed streaming bender](http://devslovebacon.com/conferences/bacon-2012/talks/stories-from-a-music-fueled-distributed-streaming-bender)
