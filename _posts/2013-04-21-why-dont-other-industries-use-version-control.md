title: Why don't other industries use version control?

It's easy to take version control for granted when you work in software development as it's such an integral part of the process. But it's virtually non-existent in other technical industries.

Recently, when Github launched their new [online STL viewer](https://github.com/blog/1465-stl-file-viewing), I asked some friends who work with product and game design if they used version control for their source files. These are a few (edited) parts of that conversation.

> Product designer 1: What is a version control for my source files?

> Product designer 2: I think he means some way of ensuring that everyone is looking / working on the latest file?

> Game designer: Version control can be hella hard for some people to understand... like their mind breaks when it's explained to them.

> Product designer 2: Well, all the major 3D / 2D design packages - especially the parametric ones - do this in some form. Although it's all controlled by the software.  The packages are expensive and generally these part management components add to the price.

> Product designer 1: We've never used these tools at (redacted - major Australian electrical manufacturer) it would be so difficult to get our factories to abide by the procedures. Generally you just run an assembly and swap out old parts for new as it develops pretty sure the engineering departments at (redacted - major European electrical manufacturer) had a dedicated admin guy who would administer the 3D files. BEST JOB EVER."

I guess there is some way to go, but I can't help but think of the benefits that would be a massive benefit if there was a meaningful (and non-proprietary) way to incorporate version control into their development processes.
