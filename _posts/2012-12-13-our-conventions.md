Part of the way the team has evolved this year has required putting more emphasis on consistent coding conventions and procedures to make our collaboration smoother. Here are a few notes.

**Javascript**

[Google's Javascript style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml), plus some JSHint config.

**CSS/Less**

Our own internal styleguide.

**HTML**

Our own internal styleguide.

**Ruby**

Nothing yet, but probably the [Github Ruby Styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby) in the future.

**Git branching**

We use something vaguely between [git-flow](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/) and ["Github flow"](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html). In essence, <code>master</code> is always deployable, <code>develop</code> is a shared staging branch, and feature branches are created for major or disruptive features. I could see us moving to git-flow next year.

**Project naming**

We decided to name our projects after film directors. So far Romero (our internal CSS framework), Kubrick (our next-generation platform in development) and Eastwood (an experimental Backbone-based product page) are active, but I am sure more will sprint to life in 2013.

It's pretty lean so far, but we're making refinements all the time.
