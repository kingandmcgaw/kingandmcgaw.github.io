CSS pre-processors are all the rage these days, or so it would seem, but it can be a little complicated to get up and running with them, unless you’re using the right tools. Enter [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/). This little app does pretty much everything from compiling LESS, SASS, HAML and CoffeeScript to optimising images and allowing you to import JavaScript files into each other.

Since I started using [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) about six months ago I have been on the hunt for an app that can make the process of using it simple. That’s where CodeKit comes into it. Previously I had been using the [LESS app](http://incident57.com/less/) and on a surface level found it worked well, but it was lacking a sense of intuitiveness. CodeKit just *knows* what I’m trying to do and doesn't require much in the way of configuration, at least where LESS is concerned.

I will be writing more about how we use CodeKit at Easyart in the future, but for now I will simply say that if you are at all involved in front-end development then you should check out it out as you will surely find it will improve your workflow and potentially make you more productive.
