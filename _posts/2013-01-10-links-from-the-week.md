Some links I've been hoarding over the new year break.

* [Enabling Lean with Tech: lessons learned applying lean at PayPal](http://www.slideshare.net/billwscott/enabling-lean-with-tech-15455128?from=new_upload_email). An interesting slide deck from Bill Scott about how PayPal used a JavaScript-based stack and open source methodologies to set themselves free from their legacy technology stack and allow faster prototyping. 

* [My Workflow: Never having to leave DevTools](http://remysharp.com/2012/12/21/my-workflow-never-having-to-leave-devtools/). Remy Sharp demonstrates some of the newer features of Webkit Inspector which allow much more deveklopment to happen inside the browser.

* [A Personal Annual Report](http://jehiah.cz/one-two/). Jehiah Czebotar collected metrics about his activities throughout the year and presented an interesting report.

* [Building a Design-Driven Culture](http://blog.capwatkins.com/building-a-designdriven-culture). *Being design-driven means treating design as a partner (and a leader) in the product creation process. Look at your feature roadmap right now. Are there major initiatives and ideas that were generated directly from your designer or design team? If yes, was design in the room when the other items were created and prioritized? Congratulations, you’re design-driven.*

* The [New York Times Skimmer](http://www.nytimes.com/skimmer/) looks like it's had a significant upgrade since I last saw it. It's a really impressive JavaScript front-end to the NYT content – complete with multiple themes and keyboard shortcuts – and by the looks of it, it's also available bundled as a Chrome web app.

And a nice quote from the archives from the [Getting Real book](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/):

> There’s plenty of time to be a perfectionist. Just do it later.
