[Steve](http://www.steverydz.com) brought Jeffrey Veen's [Design For Disaster](https://vimeo.com/63525053) talk to my attention last week and I'm still thinking about it.

Veen is a real veteran of the web and an impressive storyteller. In this talk he recounts a specific disaster in Typekit's history, and how procedures set up before and after, as well as parts of the company culture had an effect on its outcome.

Some more bits and pieces I've enjoyed recently:
