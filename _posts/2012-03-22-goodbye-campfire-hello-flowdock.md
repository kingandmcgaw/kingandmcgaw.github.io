For a number of years I've really loved using [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/) for team chat and collaboration, but today I've cancelled our account. I've found that as time has gone on, and our team has grown, it's become increasingly frustrating to use. My main issues are:

* The timeline ends up with too much noise from Github commits and issues.
* Search is clunky. You can only search using keywords, and you have to leave the room to do so.

[Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/) solves these problems by using one pane for chat, and another for "Team Inbox" and Search.

Team Inbox is by far the most useful feature. We use it for:

* All Github activity. When new files are committed, you can mouse over for a full list of changes, and click to get to the Github commit page. When issues are opened or closed, they show too.
* Inbox. We feed in the [@easyartuk](http://twitter.com/easyartuk) Twitter account (you can see one of the tweets in the bottom-right corner), and all emails to our developer account, and they'll show up in our feed.

You can also comment on any of this activity contextually. So, for instance, I could comment on an email. Search is also really cool too, and you can filter by files, links, and attachments. *Without* leaving the chat.

It's been a really useful tool for us, and I can't see us going back to Campfire.
