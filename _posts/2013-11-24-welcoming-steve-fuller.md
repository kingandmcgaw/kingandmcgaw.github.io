We're excited to welcome Steve Fuller to the Easyart tech team, as a result of our acquisition of assets from Picture Cabinet Ltd. Steve was responsible for building Picture Cabinet's platform that powers a large number of print on demand sites, apps and kiosks and will undoubtably be a valuable addition to the team.
