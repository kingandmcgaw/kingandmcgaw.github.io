* [Unofficial documentation for the Tesla REST (ish) API](http://docs.timdorr.apiary.io/). I never expected to see something like `GET /vehicles/{id}/command/honk_horn` in a car!
* [2013 trends in interactive design](http://www.slideshare.net/ProphetsAgency/trends-in-interactive-design-2013). Hint: mobile-first and bold, flat designs.
* [No more 'mobile'](http://jimramsden.com/notes/no-more-mobile). The term 'mobile' is as good as useless these days, so we may need some new terms to define what we actually mean.
* [A really long Scoble interview with the co-founders of Path](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iDjrW8NqJI&feature=youtube_gdata_player). Some really interesting insights from seasoned technology veterans.
* [Design for continuous experimentation](http://mcfunley.com/design-for-continuous-experimentation). Etsy's Dan McKinley talks about some of the successes, failures and processes at Etsy.

And a quote on branding:

> The consumer now appears to believe that the brand should earn its public attention the way all of us must. Say boring, repetitive stuff and you suffer the punishment that every bad conversationalist faces. First, we ignore you. Then, we exclude you.

[Grant McCracken](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/08/the_logic_breathing_life_into_oreos_new_branding.html) in the Harvard Business Review.
