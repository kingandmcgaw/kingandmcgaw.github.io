After 16 years trading as Easyart, last month Easyart changed its name to King & McGaw.

####Background

Just before I joined in 2012, Easyart merged with King & McGaw, a highly-respected publisher and manufacturer of art prints and frames for trade. King & McGaw became the legal entity but we continued to operate under both brand names for a few years, with King & McGaw being responsible for wholesale (museums and high street retailers) and Easyart being responsible for retail (both e-commerce and offline).

While this worked for a while, it wasn't always clear which brand was appropriate when some of our initiatives spanned both wholesale and retail. It soon became clear that operating under the King & McGaw brand allowed us to maximise our strengths in publishing, manufacturing and retailing. We'd have one story to tell, and one brand to be proud of.

The decision to change Easyart's name to King & McGaw was made in December, with a launch at the start of March. Our challenge was to merge easyart.com with kingandmcgaw.com with minimum disruption to our customers.

###Challenges

there were a huge number of factors to consider, and many of them were so intertwined that the complexity was at times overwhelming

easyart.com and kingandmcgaw.com have both been operating since last millenium, so there was a tremendous number of links


* Avoid a hit in SEO and PPC
* Redirecting millions of historical links on a number of domains
* Communicating the change to our customers
* Switching server regions
* All traffic to be served over SSL
* Switch branding on all of our social channels
* Moving all mail to Google Apps
* Rebranding all emails
* Git branches/staging
* Domain names
* Changing inbound links
